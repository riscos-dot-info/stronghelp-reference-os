FSEntry_GetBytes (buffered)
#Parent FSEntry_
=>	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <FSEntry_Open>
	R2 =	pointer to buffer to read into
	R3 =	length to read
	R4 =	offset from which to read
<=	all preserved

This entry point is called when data is needed to be read from a file for which FileSwitch has no buffered data. This will not be performed on the initial open, but only on subsequent access to the file.

Memory addresses are *not* guaranteed to be word aligned.
