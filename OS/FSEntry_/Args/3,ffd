FSEntry_Args 3
#Parent FSEntry_Args
=>	R0 =	3 (Write file extent)
	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <FSEntry_Open>
	R2 =	new file extent

This call is made when FileSwitch needs to extend a file beyond its current length. For buffered files this is only called when the file is closed. On unbuffered files this is called whenever the user requests it.

On systems with no concept of extents (eg streams) this should *not* return an error.
