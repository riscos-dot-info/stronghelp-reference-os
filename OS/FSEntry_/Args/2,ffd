FSEntry_Args 2
#Parent FSEntry_Args
=>	R0 =	2 (Read file extent)
	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <FSEntry_Open>
<=	R2 =	file extent, or 0 if not applicable

This call is made when FileSwitch needs to know how long a file is. This will only be called for unbuffered files.


On systems with no concept of extents (eg streams) this should *not* return an error.
