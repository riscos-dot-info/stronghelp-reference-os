FSEntry_Args 0
#Parent FSEntry_Args
=>	R0 =	0 (Read sequential pointer)
	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <FSEntry_Open>
<=	R2 =	sequential pointer, or 0 if not applicable

This call is made when FileSwitch needs to know how far into a file the current pointer is. This will only be called for unbuffered files.

On systems with no concept of extents (eg streams) this should *not* return an error.
