FSEntry_Args 6
#Parent FSEntry_Args
=>	R0 =	6 (Flush modified data)
	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <FSEntry_Open>
<=	R2 =	load address of file, or 0 if not possible
	R3 =	exec address of file, or 0 if not possible

This call is made when FileSwitch wants you to store all cached data. This will only be called if bit 27 of the <information word=>fsys_infoword> is set and files are buffered.

The load and exec addresses are used for purposes of date stamping.
