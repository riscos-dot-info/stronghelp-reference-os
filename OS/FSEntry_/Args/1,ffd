FSEntry_Args 1
#Parent FSEntry_Args
=>	R0 =	1 (Write sequential pointer)
	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <FSEntry_Open>
	R2 =	sequential pointer

This call is made when FileSwitch needs to know how far into a file the current pointer is. This will only be called for unbuffered files.

On systems with no concept of extents (eg streams) this should *not* return an error.
