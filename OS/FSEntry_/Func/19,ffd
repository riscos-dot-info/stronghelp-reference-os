FSEntry_Func 19
#Parent FSEntry_Func
=>	R0 =	19 (Read directory entries and information)
	R1 =	pointer to (wilcarded) directory name
	R2 =	pointer to buffer
	R3 =	number of objects to read
	R4 =	where to start, 0 for first time
	R5 =	length of buffer
	R6 =	pointer to special field, or 0 if not present

<=	R3 =	number of objects read
	R4 =	where to continue, or -1 for no more

This call should fill the buffer in R2 with entries in <OS_GBPB 11 format=>OS_GBPB11buffer>.

Only count leaf names that will fit completely into the buffer. Return an error if the cataloged object is not found or a file, but return valid with R3=0, R4\<>1 for buffer overflow or more names to read, R3=0,R4=-1 if the previous call didn't detect the end but you now find that there are no more names.
