FSEntry_Func 29
#Parent FSEntry_Func
=>	R0 =	29 (Read used space map)
	R1 =	pointer to name of any object on image
	R2 =	pointer to buffer
	R5 =	size of buffer
	R6 =	pointer to special field, or 0 if not present

This call reads the used space map of an image, implementing <OS_FSControl 46=>OS_FSControl46>. The buffer is pre-filled with 0s - you must fill it with 1s for used blocks, to the limit of the image/the buffer.
# Gerph> This implies that you never return an error if the buffer is too
#        short. Would that be right ?
# N> PRM 2-574 implies this. Seems daft if you ask me.
# This entry point is only called if bit 23 of the filing system <information word=>fsys_infoword> is set.
