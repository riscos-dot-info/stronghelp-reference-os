FSEntry_Func 20
#Parent FSEntry_Func
=>	R0 =	20 (Output full information on objects)
	R1 =	pointer to pathname
	R6 =	pointer to special field, or 0 if not present

If bit 25 of the filing system <information word=>fsys_infoword> is clear this call is not made - repeated calls to <FS_EntryFunc 6=>FSEntry_Func6> are used.

This call should print information on the object matching the pathname - it implements {fCode}*FileInfo{f}. On RISC OS 2 this may be wildcarded, and all objects which match should be printed.
