FSEntry_Func 24
#Parent FSEntry_Func
=>	R0 =	24 (Resolve wildcard)
	R1 =	pointer to directory pathname
	R2 =	pointer to wildcarded object name
	R3 =	pointer buffer for name
	R5 =	length of buffer
	R6 =	pointer to special field, or 0 if not present

<=	R2 =	-1 if not found, else preserved
	R4 =	-1 if FileSwitch should resolve, else bytes overflow from disc name buffer

This call is made to resolve a wildcarded object name. If the filing system can do no better job that FileSwitch could by calling <FSEntry_Func 14=>FSEntry_Func14> and finding the first match, return R4=-1, and let FileSwitch do the job.

This entry point is only called if bit 23 of the filing system <information word=>fsys_infoword> is set.
# Gerph> This is commented on all other entries. Is this one right then ?
# N> PRM 2-571 says that this does honour bit 23. Seems logical that all that
#    follow will also, but PRM does not say so. Silly PRM.
# Gerph> Hmmm.... I'll try to get around to testing this at some point then
