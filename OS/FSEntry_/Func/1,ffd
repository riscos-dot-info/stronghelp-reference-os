FSEntry_Func 1
#Parent FSEntry_Func
=>	R0 =	1 (Set library directory)
	R1 =	pointer to (wilcarded) directory name
	R6 =	pointer to special field, or 0 if not present

This call is only made by RISC OS 2. If the directory name is null you should set the library directory to a filing system default. This call should not make the FS current - you should provide a separate command to do this.
