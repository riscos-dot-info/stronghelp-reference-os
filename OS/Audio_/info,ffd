Sample Player
#parent Audio_
The ESP Sample Player module provides both a *Command and SWI level interface to play digital sample data and digital sample files through the SharedSound module.

The module can recognise the following file formats:
 	WaveForm		&FB1
 	Armadeus		&D3C
 	AudioWorks		&BD6
 	ArmMovie (Replay)	&AE7
It will try and interpret the following as a Sound system voice.
 	Module			&FFA
It will test the following files for a header that is can recognise.
 	RIFF			&BF7
 	DOS			&FE4
 	DATA			&FFD

Using the file calls means that if the file is recognised then the data will be played correctly, if not then the data is played as raw data at whatever settings were last used unless you change these using the <Audio_Set> SWI.

You can also pass data to SamplePlayer as a pointer to memory where you have either loaded a file or where you have created some sample data that you want to play.

Controls are provided to start, stop, pause and loop the playback.  The start position of play within the data can also be set.
