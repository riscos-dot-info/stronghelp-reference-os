FSLock CMOS usage
Bytes 233-238 of CMOS RAM: five 'FSLock password bytes'.

FSLock allows more than five characters in a password, ergo, it is supposed
that you could thus brute-force a password to match that CRC, and FSUnlock since all possible passwords would be one-way hashed to a five byte value.
