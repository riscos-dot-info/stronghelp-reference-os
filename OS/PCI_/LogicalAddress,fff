PCI_LogicalAddress  (&50392)
#Parent PCI_
=>	R0 =	flags:	bit 4 => bufferable
	 	 	bit 5 => cacheable
	 	 	bits 6-8 => policy (see <OS_DynamicArea>)
	 	 	bit 30 => IO else Memory
	R1 =	PCI address
	R2 =	length
<=	R4 =	logical address

This call maps in the given PCI address (found with PCI_HardwareAddress) into the logical memory map subject to the flags in bits 4 to 8 of R0.
If bit 30 is set it will be marked as IO, else marked as Memory.
