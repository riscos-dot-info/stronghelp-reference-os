Allocates memory from a fixed, contiguous memory pool, suitable for access by other bus masters. This is provided for the convenience of drivers that only need a few simple data structures for communication with their PCI device, and don't want the complexity of dealing with cache coherency, memory fragmentation and physical page moving (<Service_PagesUnsafe=>Service_8E> et al).

Memory will be uncachable but bufferable - you must ensure that any writes you perform have taken place before another bus master reads the memory, by calling <OS_MMUControl> 1 with bit 29 of R0 set. The memory is not accessible from user mode.
