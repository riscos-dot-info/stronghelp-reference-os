PCI_ReadInfo  (&5038B)
#Parent PCI_
=>	R0 =	bit set of results required
	R1 =	word aligned buffer to receive results (4 bytes each)
	R2 =	length of buffer
	R3 =	<function handle=>PCI_fhand>
<=	R2 =	length of results written

This SWI returns an array of grubby information about the given expansion card based on the bit mask in R0.

Bit	Word returned
#Line
0	Device/Function Number
1	Bus number
2	Function handle of parent bridge
3	Slot number
4	Vendor/device ID
5	Revision ID
6	Subsystem vendor/subsystem ID
7	Class code (24 bits)
8	CMOS address
9	CMOS size in bytes
10	Pointer to description (0 for none)
11	Device vector number
12	Ethernet address (low 32 bits)
13	Ethernet address (high 16 bits)
14	Logical DMA channel
15	Pointer to vendor description (0 for none)
16	Number of MSI messages (0 if MSI not available)
17-31	Reserved for future expansion

The string pointers returned point to temporary buffers in the PCI Manager's workspace so you should take a local copy of the strings as they will be invalidated by the next call.
