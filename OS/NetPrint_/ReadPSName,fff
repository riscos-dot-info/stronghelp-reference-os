NetPrint_ReadPSName  (&40202)
#Parent NetPrint_
=>	R1 =	pointer to buffer for resulting string
	R2 =	size of buffer

<=	R0 =	pointer to buffer (R1 on entry)
	R1 =	pointer to terminator
	R2 =	free bytes in buffer

This SWI reads the name of your current printer server, or returns a null string if your printer server is only stored as a number.

Note: NetPrint prior to 5.26 is buggy, returning R1 one too great, and R2 one too small.
