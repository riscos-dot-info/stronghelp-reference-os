DOSFS_LayoutStructure  (&44B01)
#Parent DOSFS_
=>	R0 =	<structure specifier=>DOSFS_FormatSpec>
	R1 =	pointer to bad block list (terminated by -1)
	R2 =	pointer to null terminated disc name
	R3 =	image file handle

<= R0-R3 preserved

This call lays out in the specified image all necessary structures to have a valid, empty disc. It can be used:

#Indent 2
 to layout a structure on a blank, formatted disc (in which case the specified image should be the whole disc image)
 to layout a partition in a file on a disc that has already been formatted (for example for the PC emulator).
#Indent

If the given image format has no option to store a disc name then this parameter will be ignored.

The bad block list should be presented as an array of bad block addresses. Each address is 4 bytes long. The array is terminated by a -1 entry.

It's assumed that R0 gives enough information for the format - other filing systems may use it to pass bit fields or pointers to more complex structures. However, DOSFS uses a simple <table index=>DOSFS_FormatSpec> for this.

Under RISC OS 3.00 this SWI erroneously had the SWI number &41AC1, do not support this in your code.
