DOSFS_LayoutStructure  (&41AC1)
#Parent DOSFS_
=>	R0 =	<structure specifier=>DOSFS_FormatSpec>
	R1 =	pointer to bad block list (terminated by -1)
	R2 =	pointer to null terminated disc name
	R3 =	image file handle

<= R0-R3 preserved

This call lays out in the specified image all necessary structures to have a valid, empty disc. It can be used:

#Indent 2
 to layout a structure on a black, formatted disc (in which case the specified image should be the whole disc image)
 to layout a partition in a file on a disc that has already been formatted (for example for the PC emulator).
#Indent

If the given image format has no option to store a disc name then this parameter should be ignored.

The bad block list should be presented as an array of bad block addresses. Each address is 4 bytes long. The array is terminated by a -1 entry.

It's assumed that R0 gives enough information for the format - it may be that R0 contains many bit fields or points to a block of informations - the choice is up to the image filing system module. The value in R0 is used to pass enough information to specify the disc structure DOSFS uses a simple table index for this; other image filing systems may pass different informations (using a pointer if necessary) for their LayoutStructure SWI.
