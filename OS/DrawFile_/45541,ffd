This service is made whenever DrawFile_DeclareFonts encounters an object whose type it doesn't know. Extension modules should recognise the object type, declare the fonts in it and then claim the service. Errors should *only* be reported if there is no error presently known - the Drawfile module will continue after errors, but only report the first one.
# Gerph> This is stupid. There is no way to include multiple font table objects
#        unless I've misunderstood completely.
