0-1	Join style :
	  0  mitred
	  1  round
	  2  bevelled
2-3	Start cap :
	  0  butt
	  1  round
	  2  sqare
	  3  triangle
4-5	End cap
6	Winding rule :
	  0  non-zero
	  1  even-odd
7	dash pattern :
	  0  none
	  1  present
16-23	triangle cap width
24-31	triangle cap length

Note that the PRM has the start cap and end cap the wrong way round (but cross-references *back* from the start to end, making the PRM layout appear to be illogical but correct)
Note also that the values for the <winding rule in Draw SWIs=>Draw_fillstyle> are respectively 0 and {*}2{*} for non-zero and even-odd.
