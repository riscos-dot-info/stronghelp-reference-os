#Parent DrawFile_
=>	R0 =	flags (must be 0)
	R1 =	pointer to drawfile block
	R2 =	length of block
	R3 =	<transformation matrix=>Draw_transform>, or 0 to use identity
	R4 =	pointer to 4 word buffer for <bounding box=>swi_bbox> in draw units
<=	All preserved

This SWI is used to determine the bounding box (in draw units) of the given draw file, as if it were plotted with the transformation given.
