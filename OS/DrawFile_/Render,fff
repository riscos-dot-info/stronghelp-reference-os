=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R1 =	pointer to <drawfile block=>Drawfile_format>
	R2 =	length of block
	R3 =	pointer to <transformation matrix=>Draw_transform>, or 0 to use identity matrix
	R4 =	pointer to <clipping rectangle=>swi_bbox> in OS units, or 0 for none
	R5 =	flatness if bit 2 of R0 set
<=	All preserved

This SWI renders a draw file at a given screen position where that position is defined as screen position 0, 0 with the x- and y-translations as specified in the transformation matrix. Hence, to render a non-rotated 1:1 draw file at (x, y) (screen coordinates in OS units) the transformation matrix is :
#Indent 2;Tab
(	1 << 16	0	)
(	0	1 << 16	)
(	256*x	256*y	)
#Indent

The clipping rectangle is typically a redraw rectangle returned by the Wimp on a redraw window request.  If R4 = 0, then the whole draw file is rendered. If non-zero, only objects which intersect the clipping rectangle are rendered.
