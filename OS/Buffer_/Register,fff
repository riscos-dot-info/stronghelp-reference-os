Buffer_Register  (&42942)
#Parent Buffer_
=>	R0 =	buffer's <flag word=>buffer_flags>
	R1 =	start address of buffer
	R2 =	byte beyond end of buffer
	R3 =	preferred handle for the buffer, -1 to get the buffer manager to generate one
<=	R0 =	buffer handle

This SWI is similar to <Buffer_Create>, but does not claim memory for you - rather it registers your existing memory as a buffer.
