#Parent Buffer_
=>	R0 =	buffer handle
	R1 =	EOR mask
	R2 =	AND mask
<=	R1 =	old flags
	R2 =	new flags

This SWI modifies the buffer's <flag word=>buffer_flags>.

   NewVal = (OldVal AND R2) EOR R1

Ensure that you do not modify reserved bits with this call - reserved bits should be clear in R1, set in R2.
