Buffer service insert block
#Parent Buffer_service
=>	R0 =	1 (reason code)
	R1 =	internal buffer ID
	R2 =	pointer to data to insert
	R3 =	number of bytes to insert
	R12 =	value returned by <Buffer_InternalInfo>

<=	R2 =	pointer to first byte not inserted
	R3 =	number of bytes not inserted
	C set if unable to transfer all data (R3 \<> 0)

This inserts a block of data into a buffer. If the data has already been written to the buffer (R2 = buffer insertion address) then no data are copied but the buffer indicies are updated.
