Buffer_Create  (&42940)
#Parent Buffer_
=>	R0 =	buffer's <flag word=>buffer_flags>
	R1 =	size of buffer to be created
	R2 =	preferred handle for the buffer, -1 to get the buffer manager to generate one
<=	R0 =	buffer handle

This claims an area of the RMA and registers it as a buffer. It can at most hold R1-1 bytes.
If R2 \<>-1, the given number is checked for uniqueness, if it already exists, a new one is generated.

Note that you do not need any complicated calculations to write data into the buffer - it's a simply a block of memory. Get the address with <Buffer_GetInfo> and write to the buffer.
