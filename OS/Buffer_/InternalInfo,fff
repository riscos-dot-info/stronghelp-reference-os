Buffer_InternalInfo  (&42949)  (3.50+)
#Parent Buffer_
=>	R0 =	Handle of buffer

<=	R0 =	Internal buffer ID
	R1 =	Address of <service code=>Buffer_service>
	R2 =	Value to pass to service code in R12

This converts a buffer handle into an internal buffer ID, and returns the address of a service routine that can be used to access the buffer quickly. The address of the routine and the R12 value are the same for all buffers.

If an invalid buffer handle is passed, an error is returned but R1 and R2 will be correct.
