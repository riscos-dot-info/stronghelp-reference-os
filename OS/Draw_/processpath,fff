This SWI is used to perform operations on a Draw path.
#Line
See <PRM 3, page 535=>PRM-3:535>.
#Subpage specials
ProcessPath Special values
Value		Meaning
#Line
0		Output to the input buffer path
1		Fill the path in one go
2		Fill the path, doing one subpath at a time
3		Calculate output buffer size requirements
&80000000 + x	Output path's <bounding box=>swi_bbox> to block at x
x		Output path to <block=>Draw_outpathblock> at x
		The first item in this buffer should be 0, followed by a word denoting the size of the buffer
#Subpage extrafill
Extra fill path options for ProcessPath
Bit	Meaning if set
#Line
27	Open subpaths are to be closed
28	Path should be flattened
29	Path should be thickened
30	Path should be re-flattened after thinkening
31	Use floating point output (not implemented at present)
