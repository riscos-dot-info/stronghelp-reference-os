Draw dash block

#Line
4		distance into dash pattern to start (user coordinates)
4		/n/ - number of elements in pattern
4{/}n{/}	dash elements - each is a length in user coords

Each element gives a length of dash, starting with an on dash, aternating on - off, looping round the list of elements. Hence if /n/ is odd the second time round elements which were on first time round will now be off, and vica versa.
