=>	R0 =	pointer to <path block=>draw_pathblock>
	R1 =	pointer to <output path block=>draw_outpathblock>, or 0 to calcluate size
	R2 =	pointer to <transformation matrix=>draw_transform>, or 0 for default
	R3 =	flatness, or 0 for default
	R4 =	line thickness, or 0 for default
	R5 =	pointer to <join/cap block=>draw_joincapblock>, or 0 if none
	R6 =	pointer to <dashing pattern=>draw_dashblock>, or 0 if none

<=	R0 =	R1 = 0	calulated output buffer size
	 	else	pointer to end of <path marker=>draw_pathblock> in output path

This SWI is like a call to <Draw_Stroke>, except that it writes it output as a path in the block, rather than to the VDU drivers.
