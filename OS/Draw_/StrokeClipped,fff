This SWI is used to draw a path.

If thickness is zero, fill bits 3,2 must not be 01
If thickness is non-zero, fill bits 2-5 must not be 0110 - {/}i.e.{/} filling just the boundary pixels.
# Gerph> it was 5-2 but that looks silly. However 2-5 puts the bits in the wrong
#        order - I've done this, because the ordering /isn't/ relevant here :-)
#SubPage fill
Draw_Stroke default fill style
0 gives the default <fill style=>draw_fillstyle> which depends on R4 (line thickness):

R4 value	Default fill style
#Line
0		&30 - fill to boundary centre, non-zero rule.
other		&18 - fill only the boundary
