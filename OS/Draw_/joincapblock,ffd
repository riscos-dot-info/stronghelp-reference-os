Draw join/cap block
#Parent Draw_
Offset	Meaning
#Line
0	<Join style=>.joinstyle>
1	<Start cap=>.endsstyle>
2	<End cap=>.endsstyle>
3	reserved, must be 0
4	mitre limit, in form &ffff.ffff (the same form as a <draw transform unit=>draw_transformunits>); if the distance projected by mitres would be greater than this proportion of the line width then it will be bevelled
8,9	Additional width of start triangular cap, in 1/256 of line width
10,11	Extension of start cap from line, in 1/256 of line width
12,13	Additional width of end triangular cap, in 1/256 of line width
14,15	Extension of end cap from line, in 1/256 of line width

If mitres and triangles are not used then the block may be 4 bytes long.
If mitres are used but triangles are not, then the block may be 8 bytes long.

Regrettably triangles cannot be used on thin lines. (It would have been possible to use absolute widths and length on thin paths. Alas, this is not so).
#subpage joinstyle
Join style
Value	Meaning
#Line
0	Mitred (edges continue until they meet)
1	Round (a curve from edge to edge)
2	Bevelled (a line from edge to edge)
#subpage endsstyle
Cap ends style
Value	Meaning
#Line
0	Butt (a line from edge to edge)
1	Round (a curve from edge to edge)
2	Squares (a square projects from the end)
3	Triangle (forming an arrow or similar)
