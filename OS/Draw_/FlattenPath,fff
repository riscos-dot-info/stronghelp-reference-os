#Parent Draw_
=>	R0 =	pointer to <path block=>draw_pathblock>
	R1 =	pointer to <output path block=>draw_outpathblock>, or 0 to calcluate size
	R2 =	flatness, or 0 for default

<=	R0 =	R1 = 0	calulated output buffer size
	 	else	pointer to end of <path marker=>draw_pathblock> in output path

This SWI is a subset of <Draw_StrokePath>, as it will only flatten a path. This is useful if you want to repeatedly stroke a path, without having to repeately spend time flattening it.
