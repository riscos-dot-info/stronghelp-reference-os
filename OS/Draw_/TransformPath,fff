#Parent Draw_
=>	R0 =	pointer to <path block=>draw_pathblock>
	R1 =	pointer to <output path block=>draw_outpathblock>, or 0 to overwrite the input
	R2 =	pointer to <transformation matrix=>draw_transform>, or 0 for default
	R3 =	0

<=	R0 =	R1 = 0	R0 corrupted
	 	else	pointer to end of <path marker=>draw_pathblock> in output path

This SWI is a subset of <Draw_StrokePath>, in that it only transforms a path. This can save the time taken to repeatedly transform the same path, or reduce errors by transforming *before* dashing and thickening.
