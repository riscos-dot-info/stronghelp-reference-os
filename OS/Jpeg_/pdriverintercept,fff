=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
<=	R0 =	previous intercept state

This SWI is used by the printer drivers to request that SpriteExtend passes on all calls to JPEG plotting SWIs by itself calling PDriver_JPEGSWI.  When SpriteExtend passes on these calls, it ignores them itself.

You must not make this call from your own applications.
