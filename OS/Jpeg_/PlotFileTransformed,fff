#Parent JPEG_
=>	R0 =	pointer to filename of JPEG file
	R1 =	<transformation flags=>JPEG_transflags>
	R2 =	pointer to destination coordinate block, or <transformation matrix=>draw_transform>

This SWI decompresses, transforms, and plots on the screen a JPEG image held in a file. This call is the same as <JPEG_PlotTransformed>, except that memory is claimed in a Dynamic Area to hold the JPEG before plotting.

You are strongly recommended to use <JPEG_PlotTransformed> in preference to this call.
