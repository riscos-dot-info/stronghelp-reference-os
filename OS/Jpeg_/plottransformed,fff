JPEG_PlotTransformed  (&49984)
#Parent JPEG_
=>	R0 =	pointer to JPEG
	R1 =	<transformation flags=>JPEG_transflags>
	R2 =	pointer to destination coordinate block, or <transformation matrix=>draw_transform>
	R3 =	length of image

This SWI decompresses, transforms, and plots on the screen a JPEG image held in memory.

This call is similar to <OS_SpriteOp 56=>OS_SpriteOp_56>, in that the destination coordinate block and the transformation matrix have exactly the same meaning.  However, this call only supports a direct plot.
