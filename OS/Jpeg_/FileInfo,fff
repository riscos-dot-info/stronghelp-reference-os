This SWI returns information about a JPEG held in a file. It checks the header enough to return the width and height, and does a partial validation of the data.  It returns an error if the image appears to be invalid; if no error is returned you may assume the data is a JPEG image.

It is preferable to load the file into memory and call <JPEG_Info>, if you intend to display the image as well.
