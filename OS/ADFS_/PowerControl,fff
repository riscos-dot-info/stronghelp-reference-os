ADFS_PowerControl  (&40249)
#Parent ADFS_
=>	R0 =	reason code
	 	0 => read drive spin status
	 	1 => set drive autospindown
	 	2 => control drive spin directly without affecting autospindown
	R1 =	drive
	R2 =	drive autospindown, if R0 = 1;
	 	  5 × number of seconds
	 	or action to take, if R0 = 2;
	 	  0 to spin down immediately
	 	  otherwise, spin up immediately

<=	R2 =	drive spin status, if R0 = 0;
	 	  0 if drive isn't spinning
	 	  non-zero if drive is spinning
	R3 =	previously value for drive autospindown, if R0 = 1

This call controls the power saving features of the ADFS system. It can be dangerous to use this call on drives that not fully support drive spin control. The controller on at least two drives tested hang up when autospindown is enabled; a reset doesn't recover the situation, althought a power-down reset does.
