ImageEntry_Func 21
#Parent ImageEntry_Func
=>	R0 =	21 (Notification of new image)
	R1 =	fileswitch handle for the file
	R2 =	buffer size for file, or 0 if uknown

<=	R1 =	image filing system's handle for image

This call is made to notify your filing system that FileSwitch would like it to handle a new image. The image should be marked as 'stamp on next update' (use <OS_Args 8=>OS_Args008> to inform the host filing system whenever it and its <cycle ID=>FileCore_cycleid> are updated). The buffer size should be treated as a hint to the sector size.
