ImageEntry_Close
#Parent ImageEntry_
=>	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <ImageEntry_Open>
	R2 =	new load address of file
	R3 =	new exec address of file

This entry point is called when files are being closed. This entry point is called when files are being closed. If the value of R2 & R3 is zero the load and exec address of the file should not be changed (either because the FS said via <ImageEntry_Args 9=>ImageEntry_Args9> it's not possible, or FileSwitch knows it's not required).
