ImageEntry_Args 7
=>	R0 =	7 (Ensure file size)
	R1 =	internal file handle returned by <ImageEntry_Open>
	R2 =	size of file
<=	R2 =	size actually ensured

This call is made to ensure that a file is of a particular size. Space should be reserved, but it is not required to be initialised. This is meaningless on streams.
