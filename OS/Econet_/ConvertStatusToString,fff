Econet_ConvertStatusToString  (&4000B)
#Parent Econet_
=>	R0 =	<status=>Econet_statuses>
# PRM 2-664 says R0 has range 0-14 (not 11, not 12)
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for string
	R2 =	buffer size
	R3 =	station number
	R4 =	net number

<=	R0 =	pointer to buffer
	R1 =	pointer to end address in buffer
	R2 =	space in buffer

This SWI converts a status result from a prior Econet call to a string. If the station or net is invalid then station information is not given. If R0 is out of range (PRM says 0-14) this call will Data Abort/Address exception. D'oh.
