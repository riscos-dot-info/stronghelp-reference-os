Econet_ConvertStatusToError  (&4000C)
#Parent Econet_
=>	R0 =	<status=>Econet_statuses>
	R1 =	pointer to error buffer
	R2 =	buffer size
	R3 =	station number
	R4 =	net number

<=	R0 =	<buffer=>swi_errorblock>
	V set

This SWI converts a status result from a prior Econet call to an error block and then generates an error. To prevent the error, call the X version of this SWI and read R0, or set the buffer address to 0 which will leave the string in the workspace.
