Econet_EnumerateMap  (&4001E) (3.50+)
#Parent Econet_
=>	R0 =	flags, all 0
 	R4 =	enumeration key, or 0 to start
<=	R1 =	net number
 	R2 =	pointer to net name, or 0
 	R3 =	IP subnet address
 	R4 =	enumeration key, or -1 for no more

This SWI enumerates the sub networks defined in the AUN map file for an AUN gateway.

The values of R1-R3 are not valid when the enumeration key is returned as -1; all subnets have been enumerated.
With native Econet R4 is always returned as -1.
