Econet_WaitForReception  (&40004)
#Parent Econet_
=>	R0 =	handle
	R1 =	timeout in cs
	R2 =	0 if escape should *not* abort

<=	R0 =	<status=>econet_statuses>
	R1 =	0, or flag byte if r0=9 on exit
	R2 =	port number
	R3 =	station number
	R4 =	net number
	R5 =	pointer to data buffer
	R6 =	size of buffer, or size of data received if r0=9 on exit

This SWI checks the port repeatedly until either aborted, or the data is received. The block will be abandoned after it has been received. As this SWI enables interrupts it should not be called from service or event handlers.
