#Parent Econet_
<=	R0 =	Clock period in 0.25µs steps, eg. 10µs = 40, or 0 if no clock
 	R1 =	Clock frequency in kHz, eg. 100kHz = 100, or 0 if no clock
 	R2 =	corrupted
 	R3 =	corrupted

This SWI provides details on the network clock. An error is returned if the network is not using native Econet as the transport.
