SCSI_Register (&403FF)
=>	R0 =	Bit 0:	0 => device, 1 => bus
	 	Bits 8-15:  highest device number (if bus)
	 	Bits 16-23: default host ID (if bus) - 255 signifies no host ID
	 	other bits reserved
	R1 -> <handler code=>SCSI_SoftHandler>
	R2 =	value to pass in R12 to the handler
	R3 =	value to pass in R8 to the handler
<=	R0 =	device / bus ID (bus ID has LUN/Device fields 0)

This call registers a hardware driver with the SCSI Switcher.
