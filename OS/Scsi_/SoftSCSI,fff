About the SCSI Switcher system
#Parent SCSI_

Previously numerous 3rd parties all implemented subtly incompatible entire SCSI systems for each of their podules, and maintained various incompatible filing systems (some called "SCSI::" and some called "SCSIFS::") and accompanying filers. This meant manufacturer's podules couldn't be mixed and applications programs had to tread carefully when interacting with the system.

As an increasing number of devices are using SCSI command protocols over non-SCSI connections, for example ATAPI (SCSI-over-ATA); Iomega Zip drives (SCSI-over-Parallel); and USB Mass Storage devices (SCSI-over-USB), the centralised SCSI Switcher system was introduced to clear up all of the incompatibility problems.

It works on the same principal as <CDFS=>CDFS_> and the CDFSSoft drivers, where a central filing system and filer talk to a generic driver which dispatches the SCSI SWIs to multiple SCSISoft hardware drivers. SCSI hardware drivers interfacing to the SCSI Switcher can be simpler than a full SCSIdriver module, as the Switcher itself handles many of the higher-level calls and details like device reservation.
