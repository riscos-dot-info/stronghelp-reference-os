PDriver_DeclareDriver  (&80156)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	pointer to driver's <reason code handler=>.handler>
	R1 =	pointer to driver's private word
	R2 =	<printer driver number=>PDriver_printernumbers>

This SWI registers a printer driver with the PDriver sharer module, and should be made by the driver when it starts, or when it receives <Service_PDriverStarting=>Service_65>. Drivers can be selected with <PDriver_SelectDriver>.
# N> Odd, that.
#Subpage handler
PDriver sharer
The sharer itself handles:

è	<PDriver_DeclareDriver>
è	<PDriver_RemoveDriver>
è	<PDriver_SelectDriver>
è	<PDriver_EnumerateDrivers>

For all other SWIs it sets register as follows and then branches to the driver's reason code handler:

R11	reason code (SWI number - &80140)
R12	pointer to private word (passed to PDriver_DeclareDriver in R1)
R14	return address

The handler code should implement SWIs as documented, returning errors by the conventional means (in R0, V set).
