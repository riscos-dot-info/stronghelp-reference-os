PDriver_RemoveDriver  (&80157)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	<printer driver number=>PDriver_printernumbers>

This SWI deregisters a printer driver from the PDriver sharer module, cancelling all jobs associated with it. This can confuse (and crash) some applications - it is wise for the driver to check that it has no pending jobs before calling this SWI.
# N> Quite how the *driver* should do this is not mentioned by the PRM!
