PDriver_EndJob  (&80148)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	file handle of job

This SWI ends a print job normally, which may still result in further output ({/}e.g.{/} PostScript trailer comments). If the job in R0 is the currently active job then there will be no current print job after this call - hence plotting calls will no longer be intercepted. Otherwise there is no effect on the current job (if any) and the state of plotting interception.
