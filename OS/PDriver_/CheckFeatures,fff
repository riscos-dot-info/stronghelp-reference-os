PDriver_CheckFeatures  (&80142)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	mask for <features word=>PDriver_features>
	R1 =	value for <features word=>PDriver_features>
<=	R0, R1 preserved

This SWI checks the capabilities of the printer. If (R0 AND features word) = (R0 AND R1) then the SWI returns immediately. Otherwise an error is generated *if* the printer does not support the requested features (so *no* error is generated if you request only axis preserving rotations, and the driver can actually perform arbitary rotations).
