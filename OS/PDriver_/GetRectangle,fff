PDriver_GetRectangle  (&8014D)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R1 =	pointer to 4 word block to receive <rectangle to print=>PDriver_rectangle>

<=	R0 =	0 if finished
	R1 =	preserved
	R2 =	ID word for this rectangle

This SWI is called to get further rectangles to print.

If R0 is 0 on return then R2 and the buffer pointed to by R1 are undefined. Otherwise R0 gives the number of copies still to print - this is intended for display to users only, as it may not decrease smoothly.
