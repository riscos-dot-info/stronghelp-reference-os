PDriver_GetRectangle  (&8014D)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R1 =	pointer to 4 word block to receive <rectangle to print=>PDriver_rectangle>

<=	R0 =	0 if finished
	 	bit 24 set, this rectangle is for pre-scan only [3.60+]
	R1 =	preserved
	R2 =	ID word for this rectangle

This SWI is called to get further rectangles to print.

If R0 is 0 on return then R2 and the buffer pointed to by R1 are undefined. Otherwise R0 gives the number of copies still to print - this is intended for display to users only, as it may not decrease smoothly.

Pre-scanning is used by the JPEG printer drivers to ascertain memory requirements, but should always be enabled when available for future compatibility. In general pre-scanning is transparent to applications, so bit 24 can be ignored.
