This SWI is used by the Printers application to add a font name to the list known for the current printer. If there is no current job it is added to a global list, else it is added to a local list for the current job. Each job's list is initialised as a copy of the global list when it is started.

Native font names are case sensitive, and may be null (for example, a direct driver printer).
