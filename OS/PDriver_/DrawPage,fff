=>	R0 =	bits 0 - 23 	number of copies to print
	 	bit 24	application knows about pre-scan of rectangles by printer driver [3.60+]
	 	bits 25-31 reserved (must be zero)
	R1 =	pointer to 4 word block to receive <rectangle to print=>PDriver_rectangle>
	R2 =	page number within the document (for user information) or 0
	R3 =	pointer to <page number string=>.number> (or 0 for none)

<=	R0 =	0 if finished
	 	if bit 24 set, this rectangle is for pre-scan only
	R1 preserved
	R2 =	ID word for this rectangle
	R3 preserved 

This SWI is called after all rectangles have been specified with <PDriver_GiveRectangle>, and returns the first rectange to print. Subsequent rectangles are retrieved with <PDriver_GetRectangle>.

Use <PDriver_Info> to check whether the flags byte in R0 is supported by the printer driver. If the printer driver doesn't expect the flags byte, you must not set bit 24. If it does, you should.

If R0 is 0 on return then R2 and the buffer pointed to by R1 are undefined. Otherwise R0 gives the number of copies still to print - this is intended for display to users only, as it may not decrease smoothly.

#subpage number
Printer page number strings
The page number string should only contain characters in the range {*}33{*}-126 ({/}i.e.{/} no spaces), and is used by some printer drivers for commenting the output. It is acceptable to have no page number string - use a 0 pointer.
