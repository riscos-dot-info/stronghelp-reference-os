PDriver_EnumerateDrivers  (&80159)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	previous handle, 0 to start

<=	R0 =	next handle, 0 marks end
	R1 =	<printer driver number=>PDriver_printernumbers>

This SWI will return the numbers of all printer drivers present. Experimentation reveals that the last valid R1 occurs with R0 \<> 0; when R0 = 0 on exit R1 is garbage.
