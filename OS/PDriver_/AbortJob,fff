PDriver_AbortJob  (&80149)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	file handle of job

This SWI ends a print job abnormally, and will result in *no* further output ({/}e.g.{/} no PostScript trailer comments). It should be called immediately you receive an error while printing, before you attempt to display the error message.

If the job in R0 is the currently active job then there will be no current print job after this call - hence plotting calls will no longer be intercepted. Otherwise there is no effect on the current job (if any) and the state of plotting interception.
