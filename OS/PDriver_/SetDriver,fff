=>	R1 =	<printer dumper number=>PDumper_numbers>
	R2 =	pointer to command to ensure dumper present
	R3 =	pointer to 256 bytes of dumper configuration data
	R4 =	pointer to 256 bytes of <PDriverDP and dumper configuration data=>PDriver_SetDriverblock>
	R5 =	<configuration word=>PDumper_configword> for dumper

This SWI sets the current printer dumper by calling <PDumper_Reason_SetDriver>. The *Command in R2 is issued if the requested dumper is not currently loaded. The blocks in R3 and R4 are both copied by PDriverDP - hence the originals may be discarded. The R3 block contains the name of the palette file to use - this gets passed to the dumper module now, but is not really needed until <PDumper_StartJob>, which is usually called from <PDumperReason_StartJob>.
