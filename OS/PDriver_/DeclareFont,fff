PDriver_DeclareFont  (&80155)
#Parent PDriver_
=>	R0 =	font handle (or 0)
	R1 =	0 (or font name)
	R2 =	<flags=>.flags>

This SWI declares the fonts used in a document, and should be called for each <distinct=>.distinct> font, either by handle or by name, after you have called <PDriver_SelectJob> or <PDriver_SelectIllustration>, but before <PDriver_DrawPage>.
# Could that sentance BE any longer
Not using this SWI may cause the printer driver to default to downloading a lot of unnecessary font information, or finding that the font you later select is not available on the printer.

Check the <features word=>PDriver_features> to verify that the driver does support this SWI.

Distinct fonts
Fonts are "distinct" if they differ in name, encoding or matrix - in other words if their <Font identifiers=>Font_identifier> differ in any way. Size and colour differences do *not* make fonts distinct.
# Gerph> I'd assume that font identifiers given in different orders, or
#        cases are the same. However, I have no supporting proof as yet.
