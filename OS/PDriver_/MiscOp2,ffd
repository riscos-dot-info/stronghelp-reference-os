#Parent PDriver_MiscOp
To find size of buffer
=>	R0 =	2 (reason code)
	R1 =	0 to return required size of buffer
	R2 =	0
	R3 =	header size to add to buffer size
	R4 =	0 (flags, all reserved)

<=	R1,R3,R4 preserved
	R2 =	size of buffer + size in R3

To enumerate
=>	R0 =	2 (reason code)
	R1 =	pointer to <buffer=>.buffer>
	R2 =	size of buffer
	R3 =	previous handle, 0 to start
	R4 =	0 (flags, all reserved)

<=	R1 =	pointer to first free byte in buffer
	R2 =	free bytes in buffer
	R3 =	updated handle (0 means end)
	R4 preserved

This SWI is used by the Printers application to list the fonts known by the current printer. If there is no current job it is added to a global list, else it is added to a local list for the current job. Each job's list is initialised as a copy of the global list when it is started.
#Subpage buffer

Offset	Contents
#Line
0	pointer to control terminated RISC OS <font name=>Font_identifier>
4	pointer to printer's native font name (control terminated)
8	<printer code flags=>PDriver_MiscOp0flags>

The pointed-to strings will become invalid if the relevent font is deleted by a call to <PDriver_MiscOp 1=>PDriver_MiscOp1>.
