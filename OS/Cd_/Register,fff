#Parent CD_
{f25}Þ{f}	R0 =	pointer to a <block=>CD_infoblock>
	R1 =	pointer to a 1-word special tag (&EE50EE50), followed by <handler code=>.code>
	R2 =	pointer to workspace for the soft-loadable module (passed in R12 to the handler)

{f25}Ü{f}	block at R0 updated

This call registers the soft-loadable driver with the CDFSDriver module. The block pointed to by R0 on entry must be in RAM, whereas anything else, i.e. the code for each CD _SWI, can be in ROM. The block must stay put in the memory so that CDFSDriver can check it when detecting drive types.
