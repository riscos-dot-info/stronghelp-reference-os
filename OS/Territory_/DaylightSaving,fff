#Line
This call returns details on the daylight saving applicable in the given territory.
#Subpage reason0
Read current DST state
<=	R0 =	state
	 	b0 = DST active when set
	 	b1 = DST managed automatically when set

This is equivalent to the *STATUS command.
#Subpage reason1
Write current DST state
=>	R2 =	new state
	 	b0 = DST active when set
	 	b1 = DST managed automatically when set

This is equivalent to the *CONFIGURE command.
#Subpage reason2
Supported
<=	R0 =	1 if the territory supports this API (error or 0 if not)
#Subpage reason3
Apply rule to ordinals
=>	R2 =	timezone within territory
	R3 =	buffer containing UTC <time ordinals=>Territory_Convert_time_block_in>
<=	R0 =	state
	 	b0 = DST active when set
#Subpage reason4
Apply rule to time
=>	R2 =	timezone within territory
	R3 =	buffer containing UTC time
<=	R0 =	state
	 	b0 = DST active when set
#Subpage reason5
Get bounds for given year
=>	R2 =	timezone within territory
  	R3 =	year, or -1 for current
  	R4 =	5 byte buffer for DST start time
  	R5 =	5 byte buffer for DST end time

Remember that in the southern hemisphere DST ends earlier in the year than it starts, don't assume the end time is greater than the start in that case.
