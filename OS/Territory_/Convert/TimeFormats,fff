=>	R0 =	<territory number=>Territory_numbers>, or -1 for current
	R1 =	pointer to input block
	R2 =	pointer to output block
	R3 =	format specifier and flags
	 	b0-7  	= input <format=>.formats>
	 	b8-15 	= output <format=>.formats>
	 	b16   	= convert as though DST was in use
	 	b17   	= if DST calculation fails use standard time instead of returning an error
	 	b18   	= calculate b16 automatically
	 	b19   	= treat R4 as the signed centisecond timezone offset
	 	b20-31	= reserved, set to 0
	R4 =	timezone within territory (b19 clear) else centiseconds (b19 set)

This SWI converts one time representation into another, accounting for local time if requested.

Input ordinals need only be the <7 word format=>Territory_Convert_time_block_in>, but output will always be <9 word format=>Territory_Convert_time_block_out>.
The territory, timezone, and DST flags are only needed for UTC to local/local to UTC conversions.
