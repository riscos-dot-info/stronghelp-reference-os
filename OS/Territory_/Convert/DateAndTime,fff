Territory_ConvertDateAndTime  (&4304B)
#Parent Territory_
=>	R0 =	<territory number=>Territory_numbers>, or -1 for current
	R1 =	pointer to 5 byte UTC time
	R2 =	pointer to output buffer
	R3 =	size of buffer and flags
	 	b0-15	space in the buffer
	 	b16-27	reserved, must be 0
	 	b28	set to use DST offset of R5 timezone
	 	 	clear to use NoDST offset of R5 timezone
	 	b29	set to interpret R5 as timezone within territory
	 	 	clear to interpret R5 as centiseconds offset from UTC
	 	b30	set to use R5 
	 	 	clear to use <Territory_ReadCurrentTimeZone> as the offset from UTC
	 	b31	set to enable use of flags
	 	 	clear to behave per RISC OS 3.10
	R4 =	pointer to null terminated <format string=>swi_dateformat>
	R5 =	offset from UTC if flag bit 30 and 31 set
	 	or timezone within territory if flag bit 29 and 30 and 31 set
<=	R0 =	pointer to buffer (R2 on entry)
	R1 =	pointer to terminating 0
	R2 =	number of bytes free in buffer
	R3 =	b31 clear if flags in R3 used, else pointer to format string (R4 on entry)
	R4 =	preserved
	R5 =	preserved

Result is a string in local time, language, and alphabet.

Flags in R3 are available from RISC OS 5.20. Note the behaviour with the all the flags clear is as per RISC OS 3.10, this uses <Territory_ReadCurrentTimeZone> internally to find the offset from UTC, which only makes sense if R0 is the current territory.

Using the %TZ specifier when R5 is an arbitrary offset will output no characters for that specifier.
