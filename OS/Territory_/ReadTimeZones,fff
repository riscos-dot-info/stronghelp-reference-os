#Parent Territory_
=>	R0 =	<territory number=>Territory_numbers>, or -1 to use current territory
 	R1 =	timezone within territory
 	R4 =	"ZONE" (&454E4F5A) to enable use of R1
<=	R0 =	pointer to name of standard time zone for territory
	R1 =	pointer to name of summer time
	R2 =	offset from UTC to standard time, in cs (signed 32-bit)
	R3 =	offset from UTC to summer time, in cs (signed 32-bit)
	R4 =	0 if extended API supported

Returns information on the timezones for a territory.

Where a territory, such as the USA, spans more than one timezone they can be iterated though by incrementing R1 from zero until an error is returned (noting the return value of R4 to check if this extension is supported at all).
