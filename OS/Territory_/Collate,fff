=>	R0 =	<territory number=>Territory_numbers>, or -1 for current
	R1 =	pointer to string 1 (null terminated)
	R2 =	pointer to string 2 (null terminated)
	R3 =	flags:
	 	bit 0: ignore case
	 	bit 1: ignore accents
	 	bit 2: interpret cardinals (5.22+)
	 	bits 3-31: reserved (must be zero)

<=	R0 =	\<0 if string1 \< string2
	 	=0 if string1 = string2
	 	\>0 if string1 \> string2
	R1-R3 	preserved

This call compares strings in the given territory's alphabet. 
Bit 2 of the flags is sometimes referred to as natural collation because it would consider "File10" \> "File9", even though "1" \< "9" in terms of ASCII code.
