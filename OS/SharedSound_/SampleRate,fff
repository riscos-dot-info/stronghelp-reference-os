This SWI is used to set the sample rate used by a particular handler.  Information is returned to indicate whether Shared Sound can provide this rate and if not what is the nearest rate it can provide. Along with this is a fractional step value to suggest how the handler can achieve it's required rate. Sample frequency is always supplied in 1/1024 Hz.
