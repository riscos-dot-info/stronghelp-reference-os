	If unsuccessful V flag is set and R0 points to a SWI error block.

This SWI is used to install multiple Sound <Handlers=>.handler> into the system.

SharedSound handlers
Each handler is called with when the current driver is called if the handler is an immediate handler or on call back if the handler is either a call back or process handler. The handlers in each type are called in the order in which they were installed. Process handlers are called after call back handlers.

Each handler is passed a buffer to fill with the registers set as follows:

=>	R0 =	parameter
	R1 =	base address of buffer to fill
	R2 =	end of buffer
	R3 =	<flags=>.flags2>
	R4 =	sample frequency
	R5 =	sample period
	R6 =	fractional step as specified by <SharedSound_SampleRate>
	R7 =	LR volume
	R4, R5 and R6 are updated at the start of a buffer fill to represent the current sample frequency etc.
<=	R3 contains flags as above, modified according to the action of the handler

#subpage flags2
SharedSound Handler flags
/Bits/	/Meaning/
0	Mix. If set then data must be mixed otherwise overwrite.
1	Quality. If set then use highest quality e.g. oversampling.
3-7	0	No overrun
 	1˜30	times buffer has been overrun
 	31	Buffer overrun > 30
29	Stereo. Reverse stereo if set.
30	Set if to use volume in R7, otherwise use max volume
31	Mute if set.
#line
Only bit 0 of the above flags is implemented by SharedSound. The other flags are currently used by the Sound16 drivers.
