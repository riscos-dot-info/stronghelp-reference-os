Load and Exec address
#Parent OS_File5
If all 12 upper bits of the load address are set :

Load addr		Exec addr
#Line
# N> Hmm. It seems I need 2 {fCode} when I use a tab
# Gerph> Hmm. That's because each part of a tabbed block 
# can have its own style, but you can't use it here,
# because you want the headings in a different style
{fCode}{*}FFF{*}tttcc{f}	{fCode}dddddddd{f}

{fCode}ttt{f} is <filetype=>Filetypes:!Root>
{fCode}ccdddddddd{f} is date

otherwise load and exec address are exactly what they claim to be.
