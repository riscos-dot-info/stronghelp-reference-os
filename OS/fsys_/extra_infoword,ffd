FileSwitch client special case table
FileSwitch contains a table of filing system numbers which are special cased because they are known to fail to implement the extensions added in RISC OS 3 where FileSwitch took control of canonicalising paths and similar tasks. Prior to that, in RISC OS 2, each filing system had to retain directory state and contain path resolution code.
