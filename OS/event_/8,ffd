#Parent event_index
=>	R0 =	8	(User procedure call)
	 	16	(OS procedure call)
	R1 =	<argument buffer=>Econet_immediatebuffer>
	R2 =	<RPC number=>.RPC>
	R3 =	sending station
	R4 =	sending station's network
<=	R0-R4 may be corrupted.

These events are generated when the Econet receives a UserRPC or OS Procedure call sent by another station calling <Econet_DoImmediate>.
