Escape event
#Parent event_index
=>	R0 =	6 (event number)

This event is generated when an escape condition occurs due to escape being pressed (or received in the serial buffer with <OS_Byte 181=>OS_Byte181> enabled). It is *not* generated by calling <OS_Byte 125=>OS_Byte125>.

If this event is enabled then keyboard escapes generate this event *instead* of calling the <escape handler=>OS_handlers_escape>. <OS_Byte 125=>OS_Byte125> generated escapes always call the <escape handler=>OS_handlers_escape>.
