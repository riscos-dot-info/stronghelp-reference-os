Vertical sync event (4)
#Parent Event_index
=>	R0 =	4 (event number)

This event is raised when the electron beam reaches the bottom of the display area and is about to start displaying border colour. This corresponds to the time that <OS_Byte 19=>OS_Byte019> returns. The frequency of this event depends on the scan rate of the monitor.

If you wish to synchronise music, you should probably use <TickerV=>Vector_TickerV> rather than this event.
