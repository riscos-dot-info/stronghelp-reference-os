=>	R0 =	&AAAACCCC	<amplitude=>sound_volumes>	channel (1-8)

<=	R0, R1 preserved

This SWI is identical to <Sound_Control>, except that the parameters are packed as pairs of 16 bit values into R0 and R1. It is provided for BBC compatibility and the scheduler. Use <Sound_Control> instead if possible.

The advantage of this SWI is that it may be used with <Sound_QSchedule>.
