=>	R0 =	\< -1	disable beat counter, set bar length to 0
	 	-1	read current bar length
	 	0	read current beat number
	 	> 0	enable beat counter, set bar length to R0
<=	R0 =	(entry R0 = 0)	current beat number
	 	else		previous bar length

This call sets and reads the beat counter or bar length. When enabled the beat counter counts from 0 to (bar length - 1). Disabling the beat counter causes <Sound_QSchedule> to schedule relative to the time of the SWI calls.
