Sound_AttachVoice  (&40185)
#Parent Sound_
=>	R0 =	channel number (1-8)
	R1 =	voice slot to attach (0 to detach and mute)

<=	R0 =	preserved (or 0 if illegal channel number)
	R1 =	previous voice number (0 for no previous)

The previous voice is shut down and the new one is reset.

Different algorithms have different internal state representations so it is not possible to swap Voice Generators in mid-sound.
