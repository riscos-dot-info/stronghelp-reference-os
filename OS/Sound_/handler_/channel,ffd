#Line
0	pointer to <fill code=>.fill>
4	pointer to <overrun fixup code=>.fixup>
8	pointer to linear-to-log conversion table
12	pointer to log volume scale table

The volume scale table can be used to scale samples to the current volume.
#subpage fill
Channel handler fill code
=>	R8 =	sample period?
	R9 =	pointer to SCCB ?
	R10 =	pointer to end of DMA buffer?
	R11 =	number of channels
	R12 =	pointer to DMA buffer to store data in
<=	no registers need preserving

These values have been found by example only. It is the job of the channel handler to call the voice generators as required.
#subpage fixup
Channel handler overrun fixup
This code is never called, but for safety you should make this point to {fCode}MOV pc,link{f} which will return immediately if called.
