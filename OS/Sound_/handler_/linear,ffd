Linear handler code
#Parent Sound_LinearHandler
=>	R0 =	private word
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for data
	R2 =	pointer to end of buffer
	R3 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R4 =	sample frequency in Hz * 1024
<=	R0-R10 may be corrupt

You should fill the buffer with stereo 16-bit linear data (32 bit words). The top half of the word should be the left channel, the bottom half the right channel.
