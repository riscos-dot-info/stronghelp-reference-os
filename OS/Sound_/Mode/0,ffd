Sound_Mode 0  (&40144)
#Parent Sound_
=>	R0 =	0 (reason code)
<=	R0 =	0 if 16 bit sound supported
	 	1 if 16 bit sound not supported
	R1 preserved if R0 = 0
	R1 =	<flags=>.flags>, if R0 = 1

This SWI reads the sound system type. In 16-bit mode, <Sound_LinearHandler> and <Sound_SampleRate> are available.
