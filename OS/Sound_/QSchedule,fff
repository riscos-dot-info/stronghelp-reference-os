=>	R0 =	schedule period or
	 	  -1		to synchronise with the previously scheduled event
	 	  -2		immediately schedule
	R1 =	0		Schedule <Sound_ControlPacked>
	 	&yFxxxxxx	Schedule SWI number &xxxxxx (y irrelevant)
# cl> R1 can also be the address of some code to call, though this isn't 
#     documented and is probably for internal use only.
	R2 =	R0 for SWI
	R3 =	R1 for SWI
<=	R0 =	0	success
	 	\< 0	failure

This call schedules a SWI on the queue. Typically this is <Sound_ControlPacked>, but any SWI may be scheduled provided:

#tab
è	entry is R0, R1 as specifed, R2-R7 = 0
è	if R0 or R1 point to buffered parameters, these must be available when the SWI is called

The X form of the SWI is forced, return parameters are discarded.

When the beat counter is enabled the schedule period is measured from the last bar start; when disabled from the time of this SWI call.
