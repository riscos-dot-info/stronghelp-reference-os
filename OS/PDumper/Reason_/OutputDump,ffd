	R1 =	output file handle
	R2 =	<strip type=>PDumper_striptypes>
	R3 =	dump width (pixels)
	R4 =	strip height (pixels)
	R5 =	strip width (bytes - add to R1 to descend 1 line)
	R6 =	<halftoning information=>PDumper_halftoning>

This is called when PDriverDP has generated a strip (taking interlacing into account). R0 points at the sprite format data, *not* the header, which will be either 1 or 8 bits-per-pixel.
