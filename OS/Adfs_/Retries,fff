ADFS_Retries  (&40244)
#Parent ADFS_
=>	R0 =	mask of bits to change
	R1 =	new values of bits to change

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	R0 AND entry value of R1
	R2 =	old value of retry word
	R3 =	new value of retry word

This call sets up the number of retries used by writing to the retry word. The format of the word is:

#Tab
Byte	Number of retries for
#Line
0	hard disc read/write sector
1	floppy disc read/write sector
2	floppy disc mount (per copy of the disc map)
3	verify after *Format, before sector is considered a defect

The new value is calculated as follows:
  (old value AND NOT R0) EOR (R1 AND R0)
#Line
