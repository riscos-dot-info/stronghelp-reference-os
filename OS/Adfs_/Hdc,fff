#Parent ADFS_
=>	R2 =	address of alternative hard disc controller
	R3 =	address of poll location for IRQ/DRQ
	R4 =	bits for IRQ/DRQ
	R5 =	address to enable IRQ/DRQ
	R6 =	bits to enable IRQ/DRQ

This call sets up the address of the ST5056 hard disc controller to be used by the ADFS. For instance, an expansion card can supply an alternative controller to the one normally used. The controller must be an HD63463 (or compatible).

The polling and interrupt sense is done using:
#Indent 2;fcode
LDRB  <Rn=>Assembly:Rn>,[poll location]
TST   Rn,[poll bits]
#Indent;f

The IRQ/DRQ must be 1 when active.
