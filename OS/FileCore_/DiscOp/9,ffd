FileCore_DiscOp 9
#Parent FileCore_DiscOp
=>	R1 =	9 + <flags=>FileCore_DiscOp_flags>
	R2 =	<disc address=>FileCore_discaddress>
	R3 =	pointer to block to read into
	R4 =	size to read
	R6 =	cache handle

<=	R2 =	next disc address
	R3 =	next free address
	R4 =	unread bytes
	R6 =	cache handle

This reason code reads sectors via a cache held in RMA, and isn't available under RISC OS 2.

To start a sequence of these operations, set R6 (cache handle) to zero on entry. Its value will be updated on exit, and subsequent calls should use this new values. Bits 4-7 of R1 should be zero, but are ignored if set.

To discard the cache once finished, just call <FileCore_DiscardReadSectorsCache>.
Note: For RISC OS 3.60, the value in R2 will be rounded down to be sector aligned.
