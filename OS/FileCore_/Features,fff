FileCore_Features  (&4054D) (5.00+)
#Parent FileCore_
<=	R0 =	bitmask of supported features
	 	bit 0: FileCore supports <new error=>FileCore_newerrors> scheme
	 	bits 1-31: reserved, equal to zero

This call returns additional features supported by FileCore and is only of use to filing systems which register with FileCore as a FileCore filing system.

Of course, with old versions of FileCore this will be an unknown SWI, so your code might go:
#indent 2
#tab fCode, fCode, fStd
SWI	"XFileCore_Features"
MOVVS	R0, #0	; no new features at all
:
#indent
