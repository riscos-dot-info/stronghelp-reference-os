FileCore_FloppyStructure  (&40544)
#Parent FileCore_
=>	R0 =	pointer to buffer (must be >= 4k long)
	R1 =	pointer to <disc record=>FileCore_disc> describing shape and format
	R2	bit 7 set : old directory structure
	 	bit 6 set : old map
	R3 =	pointer to <list of defects=>FileCore_defectlist>

<=	R3 =	total size of structure created

This call creates a RAM image of a floppy disc map and root directory entry.

The pointer to a list of defects is only needed for new map discs. You don't need to know a FileCore instance private word to use this call; instead the disc record tells FileCore which filing system is involved.
