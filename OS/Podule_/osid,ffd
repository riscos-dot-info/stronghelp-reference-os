Expansion Card operating system identity byte
#Parent Podule_
The operating system identity byte is the first byte in the Chunk Directory entry. It is formed of two nybbles:
High Nybble	Low Nybble	Meaning
(bits 7-4)	(bits 3-0)
#Line
 8		 		Acorn OS 0: Arthur/RISC OS
 		0		Loader
 		1		<Relocatable Module=>OS_Module>
 		2		BBC ROM
 		3		<Sprite=>OS_SpriteOP>
 		4		File (generic)
 9		 		Acorn OS 1: ARX
 		0		Loader
 10		 		Acorn OS 2: RISCiX
 		0		Loader
 11		 		Acorn OS 3: Helios
 		0		Loader
 14		 		manufacturer defined
 		0-15		manufacturer specific
 15		 		Device data
 		0		link (points to another directory)
 		1		serial number		(string)
 		2		date of manufacture	(string)
 		3		modification status	(string)
 		4		place of manufacture	(string)
 		5		description		(string)
 		6		part number		(string)
 		7		ethernet EUI48		(6 bytes)
 		8		hardware revision		(1 word)
 		9		cyclic redundancy check		(2 or 4 bytes)
 		15		empty chunk

It is intended that the string values are for human inspection (rather than for programs to read). The first 'description' chunk encountered will be used in the listing for *PODULES and so is recommended as a minimum.
