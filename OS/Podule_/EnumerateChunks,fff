#Parent Podule_
=>	R0 =	chunk number

<=	R0 =	0 (no more chunks)
or
<=	R0 =	next chunk number (non-zero even for last chunk)

This SWI reads information about a chunk from the chunk directory. If the chunk is a loader, RISC OS also loads it. The copy of a module's name string is held in the Expansion Card Manager's workspace, and will become invalid after the next call to the Expansion Card Manager.

Note that the last valid chunk entry will *still* return a non-zero number for the next chunk - when this SWI is called again with R0 >= this number it will return R0 = 0, signifying the end of the chunk directory.
