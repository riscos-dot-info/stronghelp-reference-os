Expansion Card loader
#Parent Podule_
The loader provides a simple interface that lets the Expansion Card manager access the card's code space. The regiser usage is common to the 4 entry points.

=>	R0	user data, or byte to read/write
	R1	user data, or address
	R2	user data
	R11	<combined hardware address=>Podule_combinedhardwareaddress>
	R13	FD stack
<=	R2,R3,R10 may be corrupted

Entry points:

Offset	Code 
#Line
0	Read a byte
4	Write a byte
8	Reset card
12	<Podule_CallLoader>

Return with BICS pc, lr, #V_bit, or V set and an error in R0. An error pointer of 0 will generate a default error.
