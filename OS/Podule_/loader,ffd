Expansion Card loader
#Parent Podule_
The loader provides a simple interface that lets the Expansion Card manager access the card's code space. The register usage is common to the 4 entry points.

=>	R0	user data, or byte to read/write
	R1	user data, or address
	R2	user data
	R11	<combined hardware address=>Podule_combinedhardwareaddress>
	R13	FD stack
<=	R2,R3,R10 may be corrupted

Entry points:

Offset	Code 
#Line
0	Read a byte
4	Write a byte
8	Reset card
12	<Podule_CallLoader>
16	"32OK" (magic word indicating the loader can be run on a 32 bit system)

#Line
As the loader is (and has always been) entered with V clear the simplest non-error exit is {fCode}MOV pc,lr{f}.
This is contrary to the RISC OS 3 PRM which recommends a {fCode}BICS pc,lr,#V_bit{f}, which then renders the loader only suitable for use on old systems where the ARM is running in 26 bit mode.
Exit with V set and an error in R0 if you wish to return an error, but to save space in the loader ROM an error pointer of 0 will generate a default error.
