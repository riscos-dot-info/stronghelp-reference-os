Expansion Card chunk directory
#Parent Podule_
The chunk directory consists of a series of 8 byte entries, terminated by four zero bytes.

Format of a chunk directory entry:

Size	Meaning
#Line
1	<Operating system identity byte=>Podule_osid>
3	size of chunk (bytes)
4	start (offset from base of card's identity space)

If a chunk directory is present, then it *must* be preceded by 16 bytes of <interrupt status pointers=>Podule_isp>, even if these are not used. The chunk directory is the start of the area of expansion card space where the bit width is set from the <extended ECId=>Podule_eECId>.
