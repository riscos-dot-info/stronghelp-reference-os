This SWI reads information about a chunk from the chunk directory. If the chunk is a loader, RISC OS also loads it. Copies of a module's name and help strings are held in the Expansion Card Manager's workspace, and will become invalid after the next call to it.

Note that the last valid chunk entry will *still* return a non-zero number for the next chunk - when this SWI is called again with R0 >= this number it will return R0 = 0, signifying the end of the chunk directory.
