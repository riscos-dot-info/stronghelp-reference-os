Podule_RawWrite  (&40288)
#Parent Podule_
=>	R0 =	offset (0 - &FFF) from podule's address space base.
	R1 =	number of bytes
	R2 =	pointer to buffer
	R3 =	expansion card number

This SWI writes bytes directly to an expansion card's address space, typically to write hardware registers. Use <Podule_WriteBytes> to write to an expansion card's code space.

Do *not* try to write to an <extension ROM=>OS_ModuleROMSections> - this will probably result in the memory or video controllers being reprogrammed.
