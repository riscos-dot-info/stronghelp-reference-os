Podule_ReadInfo  (&4028D) (3.50+)
#Parent Podule_
=>	R0 =	bit set of results required
	R1 =	word aligned buffer to receive results (4 bytes each)
	R2 =	length of buffer
	R3 =	<ROM section=>OS_ModuleROMSections>
<=	R2 =	length of results written

This SWI returns an array of grubby information about the given expansion card based on the bit mask in R0.

Bit	Word returned
#Line
0	Expansion card/Extension ROM number
1	Synchronous base address of card (or NIC chip base address), or zero for none
2	CMOS address
3	CMOS size
4	Extension ROM (or NIC ROM) base address
5	Expansion card ID byte
6	Product type
7	Combined hardware address (Sync base OR'd CMOS address)
8	Pointer to description string, or zero for none
9	EASI address, or zero for none
10	EASI size
11	Primary DMA channel logical number (or -1 for none)
12	Secondary DMA channel logical number (or -1 for none)
13	IRQ status register
14	IRQ request register
15	IRQ mask register
16	IRQ bit mask to apply to the above 3 registers
17	IRQ device number for <OS_ClaimDeviceVector>
18	FIQ as IRQ status register
19	FIQ as IRQ request register
20	FIQ as IRQ mask register
21	FIQ as IRQ bit mask to apply to the above 3 registers
22	FIQ as IRQ device number for <OS_ClaimDeviceVector>
23	FIQ status register
24	FIQ request register
25	FIQ mask register
26	FIQ bit mask to apply to the above 3 registers
27	Ethernet address, low 32 bits
28	Ethernet address, remaining 16 bits
29	MEMC address, or zero for none
30	Reserved
31	Reserved

The string pointers returned point to temporary buffers in the Expansion Card Manager's workspace so you should take a local copy of the strings as they will be invalidated by the next call.
