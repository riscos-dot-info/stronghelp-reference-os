=>	R0 =	offset (0 - &FFF) from podule's address space base.
	R1 =	number of bytes
	R2 =	pointer to buffer
	R3 =	<ROM section=>OS_ModuleROMSections>

This SWI reads bytes directly from an expansion card or extension ROM's address space, typically to read hardware registers. Use <Podule_ReadBytes> to read from an expansion card's code space.
