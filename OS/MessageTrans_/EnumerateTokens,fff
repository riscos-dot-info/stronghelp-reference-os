MessageTrans_EnumerateTokens  (&41505)
#Parent MessageTrans_
=>	R0 =	pointer to 4-word data structure (not 0)
	R1 =	pointer to token (possibly <wildcarded=>.wildcard>)
	R2 =	pointer to buffer for result
	R3 =	size of buffer
	R4 =	index (0 for first time)
<=	R0, R1 preserved
	R2 =	0 if no more matching tokens, else preserved
	R3 =	length of result excluding terminator
	R4 =	next index

This SWI looks up *tokens* that match the given wildcarded token specification. The token returned in the buffer has the same terminator as the wildcard in R1.
