This call calibrates analogue joysticks to return the full range of values. You sould make this call with all joysticks held in the top right position.

For full calibration, you must call both this SWI and <Joystick_CalibrateBottomLeft>. Once either of the calls has been called <Joystick_Read> and <ADVAL=>Basic:Adval> shall both return an error until the other calibration SWI has been called. After calibration the read calls will then return their full range of values.
