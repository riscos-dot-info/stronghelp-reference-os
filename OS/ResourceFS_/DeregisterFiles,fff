This SWI should be called by a module to remove files from the ResourceFS structure before the memory containing the files is deallocated ({/}e.g.{/} it should be called before a module is killed). ResourceFS delinks the files and then issues <Service_ResourceFSStarting=>service_59> to announce to programs that the ResourceFS structure has changed. You do *not* need to deregister files explictly with this SWI upon receipt of <Service_ResourceFSDying=>service_5A>.
