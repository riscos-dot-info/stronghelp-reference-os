ColourTrans calibration tables
#Parent ColourTrans_
# PRM 3-342
Tables are specified as

Size	Content
#Line
4	number of entries for component one
4	number of entries for component two
4	number of entries for component three
number * 4	entries for component one (in ascending device component order)
number * 4	entries for component two
number * 4	entries for component three
#Tab

An entry is packed in the form

	&BBGGRRDD

where	&BBGGRR	is the "standard" colour for
either	&0000DD	device component one
or	&00DD00	device component two
or	&DD0000	device component three

({/}i.e.{/} the table gives a mapping for a single pure device component to the standard RGB colour)

#Tab
To convert a device colour into a standard colour ColourTrans
è	splits the device colour into its 3 components
è	looks up each component in the calibration table
è	for entries not in the table performs linear interpolation on the two bounding values
è	sums the 3 standard colours derived from each of the 3 components

#Tab

For an interesting effect try the table

&00000002
&00000002
&00000002
&00000000
&7F7F00FF
&00000000
&7F007FFF
&00000000
&007F7FFF

Normality can be restored with

&00000002
&00000002
&00000002
&00000000
&0000FFFF
&00000000
&00FF00FF
&00000000
&FF0000FF

or by passing an invalid table to <ColourTrans_SetCalibration>, generating an error and restoring the default calibrartion.

The default calibration for the screen is linear - screen device colours are assumed to be standard colours.
