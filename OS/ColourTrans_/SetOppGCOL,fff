#Parent ColourTrans_
=>	R0 =	<palette entry=>colourtrans_paletteentry>
	R3 =	0 for foreground or 128 for background
	R4 =	GCOL action

<=	R0 =	GCOL
	R2 =	log2 of bits-per-pixel for current mode
	R3 =	initial value AND &80
	R4 preserved 

This call, given a palette entry, works out the furthest GCOL in the current mode and palette, and sets it.

The top three bits of R3 and R4 should be zero to allow for future expansion.
