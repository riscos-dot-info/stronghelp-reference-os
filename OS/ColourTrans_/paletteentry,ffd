ColourTrans palette entry
#Parent ColourTrans_SetGCOL
A palette entry is a 24-bit descriptor of the colour to be used. It is of the form :
#Indent 2;fCode
&BBGGRRXX
#f;Indent

Where BB is the blue component, GG is the green component, and RR is the red component. XX is undefined, and may be used to indicate the actual colour number, a masking value or some other arbitrary flag.
