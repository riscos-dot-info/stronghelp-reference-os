=>	R0 =	pointer to buffer for JPEG data
	R1 =	size of JPEG data buffer
	R2 =	pointer to block of <parameters=>.parameters>
	R3 =	pointer to workspace area, or 0 for the CompressJPEG module to allocate its own workspace from the RMA
	R4 =	size of workspace area (if R3 is not 0)
<=	R0 =	JPEG tag, to be passed to other CompressJPEG SWIs

This call starts the JPEG compression process, setting up various parameters for it.

The buffer for the JPEG data should be as large as possible, since the JPEG compression routines cannot guarantee to compress the image by a fixed amount.

If you wish to supply your own workspace area, its required size for a colour (24 bit) image is:
	20000 + ((image width rounded up to a multiple of 16) × 30)
and its required size for a greyscale (8 bit) image is:
	20000 + ((image width rounded up to a multiple of 8) × 9)

An error is returned if the workspace area becomes full.
#Subpage parameters

#Line
0	width of image in pixels
4	height of image in pixels
8	quality value (0 - 100): lower quality results in smaller image
12	number if 8 bit components in source: 3 => 24 bit colour, 1 => 8 bit greyscale
16	horizontal DPI of image, or 0 if unknown
20	vertical DPI of image, or 0 if unknown
