Unknown SWI vector (24)
#parent vector_index
=>	R0 - R8 =	register parameters for SWI
# Why not R0 - R8 - is this the OS bug rearing its ugly head?
	R11 =	SWI number
#tab

When an SWI is called RISC OS
1	Checks if the SWI number is \< 512 - if so it calls the appropriate kernel SWI
2	Checks whether any relocatable module defines that SWI via its SWI table
3	If no module claims the SWI it is passed to this vector, where it may be claimed
4	Any SWIs still unrecognised is passed to the unknown SWI handler, set up by <OS_ChangeEnvironment>
