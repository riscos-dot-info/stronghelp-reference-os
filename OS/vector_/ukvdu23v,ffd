Unknown VDU 23 vector (23)
#parent vector_index
=>	R0 =	VDU 23 option
	R1 =	pointer to VDU 23 queue
<=	R0, R1 preserved

Whenever an unrecognised byte (18-25,28-31) is found following 23 in the VDU stream this vector is called. R0 contains this unknown byte - it is also the first of the 9 bytes in the VDU queue, pointed at by R1.

The default owner of this vector does nothing - unknown VDU 23 options are ignored.
