VDU extension vector (27)
#parent vector_index
=>	R0 =	byte send to the VDU
<=	R0 preserved
	C set if byte is to be sent to printer

If bit 5 of the <output stream flag=>OS_Byte003> has been set then characters which would have been sent to the display are routed to this vector instead. Characters sent to other output streams ({/}e.g.{/} *Spool file, printer) are unaffected.

If the C flag is set on return, then the character (unless it is the printer ignore character (see <OS_Byte 6=>OS_Byte006>)) is sent to the VDU printer stream (if bits 2 and 6 are clear in the <output stream flag=>OS_Byte003>). This is independent of the setting of bit 3 in the output stream flag. The PRM is not clear as to whether this can send the byte twice if bit 3 is set (printer enabled). Confused? :-)
