Remove vector (21)
#Parent vector_index
=>	R1 =	<buffer number=>Buffer_buffers>, bit 31 set for block remove
	R9 =	&15
	V flag	set if examine only
	 	clear to remove data from buffer

	If single byte examine:
<=	R0 =	next byte that will be removed
	R1 preserved
	R2 corrupt
	C flag	set if buffer is empty

	If single byte remove:
<=	R0 corrupt
	R1 preserved
	R2 =	byte removed
	C flag	set if buffer was empty on entry

	If block remove/examine :
	R2 =	pointer to buffer
	R3 =	length of buffer
<=	R0 preserved
	R1 preserved
	R2 =	pointer updated
	R3 =	number of bytes still to remove
	C flag	set if buffer was empty on entry

All characters removed from buffers are sent through this vector.
If called via <OS_CallAVector> then interrupts must be disabled first.
