Insert vector (20)
#Parent vector_index
=>	R1 =	<buffer number=>Buffer_buffers>, bit 31 set for block insert
	R9 =	20, &14 (vector number)

	If single byte :
	R0 =	byte
<=	R2 corrupt
	C flag	set if insertion failed

	If block insert :
	R2 =	pointer to data
	R3 =	length of data
<=	R2 =	pointer to data still to insert
	R3 =	number of bytes left to insert
	C flag	set if insertion failed

All characters inserted into buffers are sent through this vector.
If called via <OS_CallAVector> then interrupts must be disabled first.
