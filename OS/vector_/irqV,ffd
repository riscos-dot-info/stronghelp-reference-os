Unknown IRQ vector (2)
#Parent vector_index
No parameters in registers

This vector is called when an unknown IRQ is detected. It must not be called with <OS_CallAVector>.

It was provided in the Arthur OS to allow hardware expansion to generate IRQs. RISC OS provides a new, more efficient method, and this vector is kept for compatibility.
