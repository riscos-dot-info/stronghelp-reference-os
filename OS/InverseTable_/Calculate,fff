This SWI calculates a pair of lookup tables for the current destination mode, remaining available until the next mode change. 

The 256 entry table maps from a colour number to corresponding 5 bit component colours held as 256 words of 4 bytes each. The 32768 entry table performs the reverse mapping to get back to an 8 bit colour number.
