Squash_Decompress  (&42701)
#Parent Squash_
If R0 bit 3 is set:
=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R1 =	input size (-1 means don't return max output size)
<=	R0 =	required work space size
	R1 =	maximum output size (-1 means don't know/not asked)

If R0 bit 3 is clear:
=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R1 =	workspace pointer
	R2 =	input pointer
	R3 =	bytes of input available
	R4 =	output pointer
	R5 =	bytes of output space available
<=	R0 =	<status=>.status>
	R1 preserved
	R2 =	pointer to first unused input byte
	R3 =	input bytes unused
	R4 =	pointer to first unused output byte
	R5 =	unused output space remaining

Call this SWI initially with R0 = 8 and R1 = input file size, using the sizes it reports to allocate workspace and output buffers as appropriate. Note that the current algorithm always returns R1 = -1, so you must get this size by some other means. Then call repeatedly with R0 bit 3 clear until all the data is processed (as reported via the <status bits=>.status> returned in R0). If the input is exhausted (R3 \< 12, <R0 bit 1 set=>.status>) the unused input must be resupplied.

If all the input data can be presented at once (R0 bits 0,1 clear) and the output buffer is large enough, a faster algorithm is used.

#subpage Flags
Squash_Decompress flags
Bit	Meaning if set
#Line
0	Continuing existing operation
1	More input remains after this
2	Asssume all ouput will fit in buffer (if bits 0,1 clear a faster algorithm is used)
3	return workspace needed and max output size (all other bits must be 0)
4-31	0 (reserved)
#subpage Status
Squash_Decompress statuses
Value	Meaning if set
#Line
0	Operation complete
1	Input exhausted		(R3 \< 12)
2	Output space exhausted	(R5 = 0)
