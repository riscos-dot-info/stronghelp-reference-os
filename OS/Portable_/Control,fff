Portable_Control  (&42FC1)
#Parent Portable_
=>	R0 =	EOR mask
	R1 =	AND mask
<=	R0 =	old control value
	R1 =	new control value

This call controls power and miscallaneous features:

   New value = (Old value AND R2) EOR R1

Value is a bitfield specifying:

#tab
bit	meaning when set
#line
0	Econet power enabled
1	LCD display power enabled
2	external video display power enabled
3	serial buffer and oscillator power enabled
4	dual panel mode
5,6	video clock control:
 	0	external clock
 	1	crystal ÷ 2
 	2	crystal
 	3	reserved
7	invert video clock
8	enable back light
9	display has 2 extra lines (else 1 extra)
10	2 DRAMs used for dual panel (else 1)
14	FDC oscillator power enabled
16	LCD palette set for inverse video
11-13,15,17-31	0 (reserved)

Changing bits 0, 3, 14 will generate <Service_Portable=>service_8a>.

The 82C711 shares one oscillator - this will only be powered down if bits 3 & 14 are both clear. On some machines the oscillator is used by other parts of the system and can never be powered down.
