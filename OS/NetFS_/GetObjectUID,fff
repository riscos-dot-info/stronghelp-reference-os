NetFS_GetObjectUID  (&40050)
#Parent NetFS_
=>	R1 =	pointer to canonical object name
	R6 =	pointer to canonical special field

<=	R0 =	<object type=>fsys_objtype>
	R2 =	<load address=>fsys_loadexec>
	R3 =	<exec address=>fsys_loadexec>
	R4 =	object length
	R5 =	<object attributes=>fsys_objattr>
	R6 =	least significant word of UID
	R7 =	most significant word of UID

This SWI is similar to <OS_File 5=>OS_File5>, except that it also returns a 64 bit UID for the object. This is guaranteed to be unique over all file servers on all networks. Oh, for something equivalent for local files...
