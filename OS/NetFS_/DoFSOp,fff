NetFS_DoFSOp  (&40048)
#Parent NetFS_
=>	R0 =	file server function
	R1 =	buffer
	R2 =	number of bytes to send from buffer to file server
	R3 =	total size of buffer
<=	R0 =	return condition from file server
	R3 =	number of bytes written to buffer by file server

This SWI commands the file server to perform the function in R0. If an error is returned you should copy it, as its buffer may be overwritten by subsequent use of NetFS.
