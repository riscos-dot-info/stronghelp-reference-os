RT_TimedYield (&575C3)
#Parent RT_
=>	R1 =	pointer to pollword
	R2 =	monotonic time at which to return control even if pollword is unset

Perform a time-limited sleep of the current thread and force a test of all pollwords.

This SWI is similar to <RT_Yield> except that the sleep does not extend indefinitely.
