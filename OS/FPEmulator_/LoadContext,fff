FPEmulator_LoadContext  (&40488)
#Parent FPEmulator_
=>	R0 =	<context=>FPEmulator_about> pointer (-2 for current context)
	R1 =	pointer to 25-word area as described under <FPEmulator_SaveContext>
#Line

This call allows the programmer to load a floating point context with a
specified set of register and FPSR values, destroying any pending or
incompletely processed exception in the process.

This call should almost always be preceded by one to <FPEmulator_Abort>: you
can create chaos in the floating point system by calling
<FPEmulator_LoadContext> while there is a pending or incompletely processed
exception.
#line
This call did not work correctly until version 4.17 of the FPEmulator module.
