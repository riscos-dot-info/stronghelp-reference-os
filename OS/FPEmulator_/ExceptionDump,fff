FPEmulator_ExceptionDump  (&40486)
#Parent FPEmulator_

When a floating point exception trap is generated, the floating point system
stores the current FP registers in an internal exception dump using
<FPEmulator_SaveContext>. This call returns a pointer to that register dump.
The Debugger module provides a *ShowFPRegs command to view the dump contents.

On a floating point trap, the integer registers are also stored in the
current exception register dump (<OS_ChangeEnvironment> 13 - see <PRM 1, page 316=>PRM-1:316>,
so they can be viewed using *ShowRegs. Note that floating point registers
are not stored on other exceptions, such as data aborts.
