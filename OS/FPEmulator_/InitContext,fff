FPEmulator_InitContext  (&40485)
#Parent FPEmulator_
=>	R0 =	pointer to context
#Line
#wrap off
This call should be made to initialise or re-initialise a floating point
context. It puts the context into a standard starting state, in which:

  All floating point registers contain zeros.

  The FPSR has the OFL, DVZ and IVO exception trap enable bits set. All
  other trap enable, system control and exception flag bits are clear.

This call may also initialise other less obvious context variables. To
initialise a floating point context with other registers and/or FPSR values,
use <FPEmulator_InitContext> and then switch to the context and load the
desired values with LDF and/or WFS instructions.

Note that this call should not be made on a context that is currently active.
If it is necessary to re-initialise the currently active context, make it no
longer active (by using <FPEmulator_ActivateContext> or
<FPEmulator_ChangeContext>), then re-initialise it, then reactivate it.

<Contexts=>FPEmulator_about> are only available from FPEmulator 4.12 and later.
