FPEmulator_ChangeContext  (&40483)
#Parent FPEmulator_
=>	R0 =	new context pointer (or 0)
<=	R0 =	old context pointer

This call is the standard way of changing context. A floating point context
pointer is passed to it as an argument. It switches over to using this as the
current context and returns a pointer to the previous floating point context.
It is an atomic equivalent to <FPEmulator_DeactivateContext> followed by
<FPEmulator_ActivateContext>.

Either pointer may be zero: this indicates that the floating point system
was/should be in a completely inactive state, with no current floating point
context, its undefined instruction handlers not installed, etc.
