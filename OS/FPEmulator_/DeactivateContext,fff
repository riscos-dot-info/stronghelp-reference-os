FPEmulator_DeactivateContext  (&40481)
#Parent FPEmulator_
<=	R0 =	current context pointer
#Line
#wrap off
This call deactivates the current floating point context, ensuring that
everything about the context is held in memory. It returns the address of the
current floating point context, or zero if the floating point system is in
the completely disabled state described under <FPEmulator_ChangeContext>.

You should normally use <FPEmulator_ChangeContext> in preference to this call.

Note that these calls should be made in pairs, with an
<FPEmulator_ActivateContext> call following each <FPEmulator_DeactivateContext>
call, Also, you should not allow any floating point instructions to be
executed between an <FPEmulator_DeactivateContext> call and the following
<FPEmulator_ActivateContext> call, since executing a floating point instruction
will re-activate the context and mean that the memory context may no longer
be up-to-date.

Exception: it is legitimate to leave out the call to
<FPEmulator_DeactivateContext> in the above sequence, but only if the old
context is never going to be used again: it is likely to be in an
inconsistent state if the <FPEmulator_DeactivateContext> call is omitted.
