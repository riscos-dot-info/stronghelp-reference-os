his is the call that will actually install a suitable undefined instruction
handler, depending on the state of the specified context, what undefined
instruction handlers are available and the hardware present.

This call also actually enables the floating point hardware if it is present
and wanted; in this case, it also loads the context into the hardware.

The argument may also be zero, to indicate that the floating point system
should enter the completely inactive state described under
<FPEmulator_ChangeContext>.

You should normally use <FPEmulator_ChangeContext> in preference to this call.

See the notes under <FPEmulator_DeactivateContext> relating to restrictions on
this pair of SWIs.
