Service_SCSIAttached (&20102)
#Parent SCSI_
=>	R1 =	&20102 (reason code)
	R0 =	<device ID=>SCSI_devid>
	R2 =	device ID mask

Issued when a new device or bus is registered with SCSIDriver. A hardware driver may issue this itself to indicate that a device has been attached to an ID already registered with SCSIDriver.

The mask indicates whether a bus, a device or a unit (potentially multiple) has been attached; someone wanting to rescan the bus should scan all devices with IDs such that \<device ID\> AND R2 = R0.

Examples:
#indent 2
#table columns 3
Bus 0, device 1 attached
Bus 3, device 4, unit 5 attached
Bus 2 attached
R0 = &01 (0:1.0)
R0 = &BC (3:4.5) 
R0 = &10 (2:0.0)
R2 = &1F (3:7.0)
R2 = &FF (3:7.7)
R2 = &18 (2:0.0)
