Note on Device ID and Host ID
The *device ID* is a composite of the SCSI id number, the *logical unit number* (LUN) within the device and the logical slot number of the SCSI card. They are packed into 8 bits as follows:

	Bits 2..0	SCSI device id			(0..7)
	Bits 4..3	Logical SCSI card number	(0..3)
	Bits 7..5	Logical unit number		(0..7)

The SCSI card numbering is based on the relative slot positions of any SCSI cards in the machine, thus in a machine with 2 cards, in physical slots 2 and 4 they are refered to as logical SCSI card numbers 0 and 1. In a machine with 1 card it may be placed in any slot refered to as logical SCSI card number 0.

The *host ID* is a similar composite, but of SCSI id number and logical slot number, with no LUN field.

	Bits 2..0	Host device id			(0..7) - Usually 7
	Bits 4..3	Logical SCSI card number	(0..3)

The Host device id is usually 7 and there must be no other devices on the bus with the same id.
