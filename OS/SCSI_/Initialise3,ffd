SCSI_Initialise 3 'Enumerate Device'
=>	R0 =	3
	R1 =	<device ID=>SCSI_devid>
	R2 ->	buffer for description (word aligned).
	R3 =	buffer size
#tab;wrap on

Performs an Inquiry command to see what type the device
is and then performs the appropriate Read-Capacity
Data returned as formatted text.

The data returned is a zero terminated string of the same form as that
printed by {fCode}*SCSIDevices{f}, ie

#fCode;wrap off
"ddd    ttttttttttttttttt cccc Mbytes vvvvvvvv pppppppppppppppp rrrr ssssss"
#wrap;f

where the fields are device number, type, capacity, vendor, product, revision
number and SCSI implementation level.

If a device doesn't respond, a string containing just the device number is
returned, if the device responds, but the 'read-capacity' call fails, the
capacity field will be set to unknown.
