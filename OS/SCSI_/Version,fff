SCSI_Version (&403C0)
<=	R0 =	Bits 0..7	software minor version number, 0 for any release
	 	Bits 8..31	software major version number eg. 100 for 1.00
	R1 =	Bitset of <software features=>.software>
	R2 =	Bits 0..7	hardware minor version number, 0 for any release
	 	Bits 8..31	hardware major version number eg. 100 for 1.00
	R3 =	Bitset of <hardware features=>.hardware>
	R4 ->	null terminated vendor string

This SWI is used to determine the version number of the drivers, whether it supports any particular later extension, and what particular hardware implementation is present.
