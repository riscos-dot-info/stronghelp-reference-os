SCSI_Reserve (&403C7)
#Parent SCSI_
=>	R0 =	0 - <claim=>.claim>
	 	1 - <force claim=>.fclaim>
	 	2 - <release=>.release>
	Others =	Reason code specific

This SWI allows the caller to claim exclusive use of a device and may prevent data corruption problems that may arise if a program (by accident or on purpose) issues a Write/Format/ModeSelect command to a device currently mounted by SCSIFS.

It also provides for a clean change of device ownership from one user to another, as SCSIdm for example is entitled to modify your disc, (to map out defects/format/partition it etc) but must only do so once SCSIFS has closed down all open files and dismounted the disc.
#Subpage claim
Claim
=>	R0 =	0
	R1 =	device ID
	R2 =	release address
	R3 =	workspace pointer, to be passed in R12 when release address is called
	R8 =	access key

Will return a reservation error if unsuccessful.
#Subpage fclaim
Force Claim
=>	R0 =	1
	R1 =	device ID
	R2 =	release address
	R3 =	workspace pointer, to be passed in R12 when release address is called
	R8 =	access key

This call is similar to <claim=>.claim>, however, if the device is already claimed, it will ask the current claimant to release it, by calling the release address registered for that device.
#Subpage release
Release
=>	R0 =	2
	R1 =	device ID
	R8 =	access key

Releases the lock on the given device.
