SCSIFS_Partitions  (&40995) (5.09+)
#Parent SCSI_
=>	R0 =	<reason code=>.codes>
	Other registers varying according to reason code.
<=	Dependant on reason code.

Supports splitting one physical drive into several logical drives.

1	<Lookup drive number for id=>.partitions1>
#Subpage partitions0
SCSIFS_Partitions 0
=>	R0 =	0
 	R1 =	SCSI ID
 	R2 =	Sector offset to partition start

Should not be used after mounting the disc, otherwise loss of data is likely to occur.
#Subpage partitions1
SCSIFS_Partitions 1
=>	R0 =	1
 	R1 =	SCSI ID
<=	R2 =	SCSIFS drive number
