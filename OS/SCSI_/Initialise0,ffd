This call resets all options set by <SCSI_Control> to their default
states and removes any device reservations. In addition it sets a new
host ID and causes a full reset of the SCSI bus by driving the SCSI bus
RESET line. If the SCSI card supports LED control (<SCSI_Control2>),
then the LED is switched off.
