PDumper_LookupError  (&41B08)
#Parent PDumper_
=>	R0 =	pointer to <error block=>MessageTrans_errorblock> with message token
	R1 =	0, or string to substitute for "%0"
<=	R0 =	resolved error block
	V set

This SWI looks up the token passed in via R0 in Resources:$.Resources.PDrivers.Messages, and performs <MessageTrans=>MessageTrans_> style substitution. This saves the overhead of MessageTrans routines within the printer dumper.
