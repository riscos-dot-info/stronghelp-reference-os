PDumper_Claim  (&41B01)
#Parent PDumper_
=>	R0 =	pointer to anchor word
	R3 =	size to claim
	R4 =	tag for block
<=	R2 =	pointer to word aligned block allocated

This SWI allocates a block of memory (size need not be a multiple of four) and links into the dumper's chain specified by the anchor word passed in R0 (usually the module's private word). The tag is stored after the link point - it is not advised to claim more than one block with the same tag (see <PDumper_Find>). Use <PDumper_Free> to free the block.
