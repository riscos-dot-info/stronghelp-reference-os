Device driver End of Data entry point (10)

When DeviceFS is asked if EOF has been reached, it will respond false if a buffered stream still has buffered data, or an unbuffered stream has a non-empty RX/TX word. Otherwise it calls this entry point. Most devices will return -1 (EOF reached) but some ({/}e.g.{/} a scanner) may know that there is still data to come).
