#Parent DeviceFS_
=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R1 =	pointer to list of <devices to install=>DeviceFS_devices>
	R2 =	pointer to <device driver entry point=>DeviceFS_entry>
	R3 =	private word		(passed to entry point in R8)
	R4 =	workspace pointer	(passed to entry point in R12)
	R5 =	pointer to <special field validation string=>DeviceFS_special>
	R6 =	maximium RX devices (0 for none, -1 for unlimited)
	R7 =	maximium TX devices (0 for none, -1 for unlimited)
<=	R0 =	device driver's handle

This SWI registers a device driver (the hardware interface code) and associated devices ({/}e.g.{/} buffered and unbuffered) with DeviceFS. If any device in the list fails to register then all are removed.
