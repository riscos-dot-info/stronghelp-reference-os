DeviceFS_TransmitCharacter  (&42747)
#Parent DeviceFS_
=>	R1 =	DevicesFS stream handle
<=	R0 =	byte to transmit
	C set if unable to read a character to transmit

This SWI is made by a device when it wants to transmit a character. DeviceFS will try to find character (unbuffer one, or read from a waiting stream).

{*}Note:{*}For speed DeviceFS_TransmitCharacter and <DeviceFS_ReceivedCharacter> do not validate the external handle passed - strange things will happen if bad handles are passed.
