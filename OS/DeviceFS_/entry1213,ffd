Device driver Monitor TX/RX entry point (12/13)
#Parent DeviceFS_CallDevice
=>	R0 =	12 (MonitorTX) / 13 (MonitorRX)
	R2 =	device driver stream handle

<=	VC, or
	VS and R0 = pointer to error block

These entry points are called periodically by DeviceFS if a process has been blocking on your stream for some time, allowing devices to abort a blocking operation if there is an error with the device. The calls must be enabled by setting bit 2 of the flags word to <DeviceFS_Register>.

For example, the parallel device driver uses this to abort printer operations when the printer reports an error.
