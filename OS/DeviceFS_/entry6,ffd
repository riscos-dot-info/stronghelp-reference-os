Device driver Create buffer entry points (6 & 7)
#Parent DeviceFS_CallDevice
=>	R0 =	6 (TX buffer) or 7 (RX buffer)
	R2 =	device driver stream handle
	R3 =	suggested <buffer flags=>Buffer_flags>
	R4 =	suggested buffer size (non-zero)
	R5 =	suggested buffer handle, or -1 to generate unique handle
	R6 =	suggested buffer threshold (when <halt event=>DeviceFS_entry8> is called)
<=	R3-R6 modified to driver's requirements

This entry point is called just before the buffer is created, to allow the driver to modify parameters as desired. The suggested buffer flags are those given when the <device was registered=>DeviceFS_devices>. R5 will default to -1 (generate unique handle) but you may specify the number of a buffer to link to.
