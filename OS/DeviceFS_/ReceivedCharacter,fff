DeviceFS_ReceivedCharacter  (&42746)
#Parent DeviceFS_
=>	R0 =	byte recieved
	R1 =	DevicesFS stream handle
<=	C clear if byte transferred
	C set if not transferred

This SWI is made by a device when it recieves a character. DeviceFS will then process the character (buffer it, or unblock a waiting stream).

{*}Note:{*}For speed DeviceFS_ReceivedCharacter and <DeviceFS_TransmitCharacter> do not validate the external handle passed - strange things will happen if bad handles are passed.
