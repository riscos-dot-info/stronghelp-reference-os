=>	R0 =	0
	R2 =	DeviceFS stream handle
	R3 =	flags: bit 0 clear for RX, else TX
# Gerph> In tests, I've got top bit set on these as well - what does this mean ?

<=	R2 =	device driver stream handle

This entry point is called when DeviceFS opens a stream onto the device driver. The {/}stream handle{/} it supplies must be stored, as you need it for DeviceFS SWIs such as <DeviceFS_ReceivedCharacter>. *Your* {/}stream handle{/} will be passed to other entry points - 0 is a reserved value, so you may not use this as your handle. The block in R6 will remain intact until the stream closes.
