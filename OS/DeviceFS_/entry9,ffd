Device driver Resume entry point (9)
#Parent DeviceFS_CallDevice
=>	R0 =	9
	R2 =	device driver stream handle

This entry point is called when the free space rises above the threshold (set on creation, or modified by <DeviceFS_Threshold>). It allows the driver to attempt to restart incoming data ({/}e.g.{/} a serial device could perform handshaking).
