This service converts a country number to its ISO3166-1 alpha 2 name. These are used as the top level domain names for a given country (for example, Hong Kong is 'hk' as in "www.website.hk"). If a module provides additional countries it should check this service - if the number matches one provided by the module it should claim this service.
