Service_PreModeChange (&4D)
#Parent Service_Index
=>	R1 =	&46 (reason code)
	R2 =	<mode number=>VDU:22a>
<=	see below

This service allows a module to object to a mode change, or subsitute a different mode:

{*}Case 1{*} - module has no objection

<=	R1,R2 preserved (pass on)

{*}Case 2{*} - module objects, and takes alternative action

<=	R1 =	0 (claim service)
	R2 =	0

{*}Case 3{*} - module objects, and returns an error

<=	R0 =	pointer to <error block=>swi_errorblock>
	R1 =	0 (claim service)

{*}Case 4{*} - module wishes to subsitute an alternative mode

<=	R1 =	&46 (reason code) - pass on
	R2 =	new <mode number=>VDU:22a>

<Service_ModeTranslation=>Service_51> offers a better method to support new monitor types.
