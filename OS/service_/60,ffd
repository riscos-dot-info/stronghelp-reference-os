Service_ResourceFSStarting (&60)
#Parent Service_Index
=>	R1 =	&60 (reason code)
	R2 =	address to call
	R3 =	workspace for ResourceFS
<=	R1 - R3 preserved (do not claim)

This service is issued by ResourceFS when it (re)initialises. As it is not linked into the module chain at this point, its SWIs cannot be called, so programs should call the code addressed by R2 directly:

#tab
#wrap off
#fCode
STMFD   sp!, \{r0, lr}	; stack actual return address
ADR     r0, files	; pointer to <resource file block=>ResourceFS_fileblock>
MOV     lr, pc		; emulate BL
MOV     pc, r2		; call ResourceFS code
LDMFD   sp!, \{r0, pc}	; and return
#wrap
#f

Unlike <ResourceFS_RegisterFiles>, the routine addressed by R2 does not issue <Service_ResourceFSStarted=>service_59> for each block registered. Instead it issues one <Service_ResourceFSStarted=>service_59> after all modules have received this service call.
