This service is issued by <OS_ReadSysInfo 1=>OS_ReadSysInfo.1> if the configured value for any of Mode, Monitor Type or Sync is "auto", to determine these parameters from the monitor lead. Older machines ({/}e.g.{/} A400 series vintage) cannot read monitor lead IDs
# I presume that "older machines" have 9 pin D plugs, not 15 pin sub-Ds

Monitor lead IDs
The monitor conector has 4 ID pins (0 to 3). The connection of each pin is reported as a value:

Value	ID pin is tied to
#Line
0	0v
1	+5v
2	Hsync
3	indeterminate
#Tab

The connections of the 4 pins are reported in a bitfield:

Pin	Bits
#Line
ID0	0,1
ID1	2,3
ID2	4,5
ID3	6,7
#Tab

For example the portable module recognises that 1,1,1,1 occurs when no lead is connected, and sets mode 27, type 5, sync 0.

If the service is unclaimed RISC OS recognises the following values:

ID0	ID1	ID2	Type		Sync		Mode
#Line
H	+5v	+5v	0 (TV)		composite	12
+5v	+5v	H	1 (Multisync)	composite	27
+5v	0v	+5v	3 (Mono VGA)	separate	27
0v	+5v	+5v	3 (Colour VGA)	separate	27
0v	+5v	0v	4 (SVGA)	separate	27

(Value of ID3 is not used)

If even this fails, RISC OS assumes type 0 - TV standard.
