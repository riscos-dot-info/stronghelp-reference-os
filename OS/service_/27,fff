Service_PostReset (&27)
#Parent Service_Index
=>	R1 =	&27 (reason code)

This service is issued at the end of a machine reset. General module tasks and filers should reset their taskhandles as if <Service_StartedWimp=>Service_4A> or <Service_StartedFiler=>Service_4C> had been called, ready for <Service_StartWimp=>Service_49> or <Service_StartFiler=>Service_4B>.

MessageTrans does not close message files on a soft reset - if you do not want your files to remain open this service will be useful.
