=>	R1 =	&8A (reason code)
	R2 =	0	power up
	 	1	power down
# 	 	2	tidy up
# N> Issued by Econet if it can't powerdown because of outstanding RxCBs
# Gerph> Is this something that we can document then, or just a vague one ?
	R3 =	<bitmask=>.bitmask> of ports which will be powered down/have been powered up
<=	R1 =	&8A (don't claim, unless R3 = 0)
	R2 preserved
	R3 =	<bitmask=>.bitmask> - set bits mean no objection to power up/down

This service is issued before powering down, or after powering up certain hardware. If a module wishes to prevent power down it should clear the appropriate bits for that hardware. If this results in R3 = 0, the service should be claimed to prevent it being needlessly passed round remaining modules.
