=>	R0 =	0
	R1 =	&79 (reason code)
	R2 =	device driver handle
	R3 =	pointer to device name, or 0 if whole device driver is being deregistered

This service is issued by <DeviceFS=>DeviceFS_> when a specified device has been killed - usually because a second device of the same name has been registered. If the entire driver is being deregistered, then this service is issued for each name in turn, and a final time with R3 = 0.
