This service is issued to get information about available disc formats from softloaded modules. It should be issued whenever this information is requested, in case new modules mean more formats are now available. The service must not be claimed - rather it should be passed on with an extended list.

The service issuer is responsible for freeing the list and all data from the RMA after use, or if an error occurs during generation.

#SubPage block
Service_EnumerateFormats format block
Offset	Meaning
#Line
0	Pointer to next block, or 0 to terminate list
4	Pointer to *RMA* block with text for *Format* submenu
8	Pointer to *RMA* block with help text for *Format* submenu
12	SWI to call to get raw disc format info
16	R3 parameter for this SWI
20	SWI to call to lay down disc structure
24	R0 parameter for this SWI
28	Flags:	bit 0 set for native FileCore format.

The block should be built in this order:
1	allocate block in RMA
2	zero offsets 4 and 8 (pointers to text)
3	link into list
4	allocate block in RMA for text at offset 4
5	link this to the block
6	allocate block in RMA for text at offset 8
7	link this to the block
8	*copy* text into the two RMA blocks
9	fill in the rest of the block

This allows an error to be returned by claiming the service and returning the intact list.
