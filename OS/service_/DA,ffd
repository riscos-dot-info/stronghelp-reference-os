	R2 =	pointer to module title

This service call is made after a module has been (re)initialised and after it has been linked into the module chain. This means that any SWIs etc provided by the module are available (in contrast, during any service calls issued by the module's own initialisation code, the module is not yet linked into the chain).

This service call is intended to allow clients of a module to (re)register themselves with it.
