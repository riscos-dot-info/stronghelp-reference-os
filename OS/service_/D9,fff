A new device has been attached to the system, this service call announces its arrival for any drivers which may be interested in it.

Do not claim this call, it is for information only.
#Subpage removed
Device being removed
=>	R0 =	1 (reason code + flags)
	R1 =	&D9 (service code)
	R2 =	Pointer to HAL device descriptor
<=	R1 =	0 to object to the removal, set R0 to point to a standard <error block=>swi_errorblock>

This call is issued just before the device is removed from the system, and removal will occur provided R1 is not claimed.
