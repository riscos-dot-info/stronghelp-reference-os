This service is made whenever <DrawFile_Render> encounters an object whose type it doesn't know. Extension modules should recognise the object type, process it and then claim the service. Errors should *only* be reported if there is no error presently known - the Drawfile module will continue after errors, but only report the first one.
# Gerph> /why/ should it continue ?
