Service_DeviceFSStarting (&70)
#Parent Service_Index
=>	R1 =	&70 (reason code)

This service is issued by DeviceFS when it (re)initialises. Unlike <Service_ResourceFSStarting=>service_60>, DevicsFS has the good sense to issue this service on a callback, so its SWIs ({/}e.g.{/} <DeviceFS_Register>) can be called in the normal fashion.
