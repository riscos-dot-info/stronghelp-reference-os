<=	R1 =	0 to claim (prevents application starting), preserved otherwise

NewApplication: Another means of starting an application
Whilst this is pretty unlikely, it may in future be possible to trasmit your application to another computer via a network link for execution. As such the code would have been executed directly and not through the 'standard' channels. Such a method would require the use of this Service call.
