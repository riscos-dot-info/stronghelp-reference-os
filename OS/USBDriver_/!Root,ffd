The USBDriver module coordinates communication to peripherals connected via the Universal Serial Bus. 

Its SWIs are intended for use by host controller drivers (such as OHCIDriver) and are of little use to applications or USB peripheral drivers which should use the <DeviceFS=>DeviceFS_> interface instead.

USBDriver includes basic USB peripheral drivers for hubs, keyboards, and mice.
