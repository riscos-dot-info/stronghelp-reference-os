System Devices
#Parent OS_ClaimDeviceVector
All machines after the A3000 have these system device numbers:
Number	Device
#Line
0	Printer interrupt from 82C710/1
1	Low battery warning
2	Floppy disc indexer
3	VSync Pulse
4	Power on reset
5	IOC Timer 0
6	IOC Timer 1
7	FIQ downgrade - reserved for the current owner of FIQ
8	Expansion card FIQ downgrade; this should normally be masked off
9	Sound system buffer change
10	Serial port interrupt from 82C710/1 also mapped to FIQ device 4
11	IDE hard disc interrupt
12	Floppy disc interrupt from 82C710/1
13	Expansion card interrupt
14	Keyboard serial transmit register empty
15	Keyboard serial receive register full

For A3000 and earlier the functionality of each number is equivalent, but with ST506 in place of IDE and separate hardware instead of the 82C710/1 chip.
