OS_ReleaseDeviceVector  (&4C)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	<device number=>OS_systemdevices>
	R1 =	address of device driver routine
	R2 =	value to be passed in R12 when driver is called
	R3 =	address of interrupt status if R0 = 8 or 13 on entry
	R4 =	interrupt mask to use, if R0 = 8 or 13 on entry

<=	R0-R4 preserved

This removes a driver from the list of claimants of a device vector. The device vector is identified by the contents of the register on entry; R0-R2 (R0-R4 if R0 = 8 or 13 on entry) must be the same as when the vector was claimed.

The previous vector owner is re-installed at the head of the chain. If there is no previous owner, then the IRQs from the corresponding device are disabled.

You must not attempt to disable a device's IRQs within IOC when you release its vector. For expansion card IRQs, you should prevent your device from interrupting again by programming the hardware on your expansion card.
