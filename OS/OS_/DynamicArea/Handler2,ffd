This reason code is issued when a call to <OS_ChangeDynamicArea> results in an area shrinking, before any pages are moved. You can limit the amount of memory moved out of the area. If the permitted skrinkage you return is a non-page multiple, it will be rounded down to a page multiple.

You can prevent the area changing size by returning an error. R0 should point to a null terminated error message, or be set to zero for a generic error message to be used. R3 should be zero, to show that no shrinkage is possible. You should then return with the V flag set.
