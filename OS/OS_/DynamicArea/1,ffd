This call removes a previously created dynamic area. Before the area is removed, RISC OS attempts to shrink it to zero size.  This is done using <OS_ChangeDynamicArea>.

If OS_ChangeDynamicArea returns an error, then the area will be grown back to its original size using OS_ChangeDynamicArea, and this call will return with an error.
If <OS_ChangeDynamicArea> successfully reduced the area to zero size, then it will be removed.

Once the area has been removed Service_DynamicAreaRemove is issued to inform the rest of the system about this change.

An error is returned if the area was not removed for any reason.

<Sparse=>OS_DynamicAreaSparse> areas shall be released via <OS_DynamicArea 10=>OS_DynamicArea10> before removal. If the attempt fails, the area is not removed, but no attempt is made to restore the mapping distribution as before the removal.
