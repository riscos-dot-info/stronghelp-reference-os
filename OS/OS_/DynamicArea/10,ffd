The region ( {/}base {f25}£{f} x {f25}£{f} size-1{/} ) must be entirely within the address range of the Sparse area. There are no restrictions on the distribution of any mapped memory within the region before the call.

Note that although arbitrary alignment of /base/ and /size/ is allowed, memory can only be released with a granularity equal to the page size of the machine (as return by <OS_ReadMemMapInfo>). Fragments below this granulariy and not released are not accumulated across calls. Hence, release of sub-page sized regions is not useful.
