This call creates a new dynamic area. Area numbers allocated are greater than or equal to 256.

Ill advised setting of r5 as -1
Setting r5 as -1 is *strongly* deprecated due to the problems of address space exhaustion on large memory machines. Also, a maximum size of -1 has no valid meaning for <Sparse=>OS_dynamicareaSparse> areas. New code should set the smallest maximum size that is sensible for the use required. Because old code may often use -1, a clamp may be set via <OS_DynamicArea 8=>OS_dynamicarea8> to limit the problem.
