{*}Ensures that a region of a <Sparse=>OS_DynamicAreaSparse> area is mapped to valid memory{*}

The region ( {/}base {f25}£{f} x {f25}£{f} size-1{/} ) must be entirely within the address range of the Sparse area. There are no restrictions on the distribution of any mapped memory within the region before the call.

Note that although arbitrary alignment of /base/ and /size/ is allowed, the granularity of the mapping actually performed is the page size of the machine (as return by <OS_ReadMemMapInfo>).
