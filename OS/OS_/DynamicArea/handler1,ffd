This reason code is issued when a call to <OS_ChangeDynamicArea> results in an area growing, it is called after the <PreGrow=>OS_DynamicAreaHandler1> reason code has been used successfully and the memory pages have been moved.  It provides the handler with a list of which physical pages have been moved into the area.
