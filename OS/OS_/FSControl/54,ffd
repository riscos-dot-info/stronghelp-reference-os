OS_FSControl 54  (&29)
#Parent OS_FSControl
=>	R0 =	54 (Read path of given directory)
	R1 =	pointer to buffer to hold pathname
	R2 =	<directory to read=>OS_FSControl53.dirtype>
	R3 =	pointer to name of filing system
	R5 =	size of buffer (or 0 to read required size)
<=	Buffer is filled with pathname
	R1 =	pointer to rest of path, or 0 if directory is not set
	R5 =	(buffer length) minus (length of string (with terminator))
	R6 =	pointer to special field, terminated with null or "," (or 0 for none)

This call reads the path of the specified directory.

*Notes*:	Like other OS_FSControl calls, use this call twice: after the first call (r5 = 0), and on exit r5 = -(bytes needed).
