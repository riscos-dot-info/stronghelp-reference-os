#Parent OS_FSControl
=>	R0 =	37 (Canonicalise path)
	R1 =	pointer to pathname to convert
	R2 =	pointer to buffer
	R3 =	pointer to name of path variable, or 0 for none
	R4 =	pointer to ctrl-terminated comma seperated path string, or 0 for none
	R5 =	buffer size
<=	R5 =	number of spare bytes in buffer (inc. term)

This call takes a filename (which may contain wildcards) and converts it into a complete pathmame, including disc and directory name when not provided.

#tab
*Example*:	{Fcode}fred{f} may convert to {Fcode}SCSI::Gamma.$.Utils.Fred{f}

*Note*:	If you call once with R2 and R5 set to zero, R5 will minus the return the number of bytes needed. Now you can call again having allocated -R5 bytes from somewhere.
