OS_FSControl 25  (&29)
#Parent OS_FSControl
=>	R0 =	25 (Rename object)
	R1 =	pointer to original filename
	R2 =	pointer to new filename

This SWI allows you to rename a file. It can only rename objects to new names on the same filing system and disc - otherwise use <move=>OS_FSControl26> (copy with delete). There is no SWI to discover which disc a given file is on - hence it is impossible to ascertain whether this SWI will fail without actually calling it.
