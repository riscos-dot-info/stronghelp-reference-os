#Wrap

This SWI flushes and closes all open files on all filing systems. It does not stop if an individual close reports an error, but will only return without error if all individual closes were error free. It informs all filing systems of the shutdown - this means that:

è	NetFS logs off from all file servers
è	FileCore dismounts all discs
è	disc heads are parked

It is equivalent to {fCode}*Shutdown{f}.
