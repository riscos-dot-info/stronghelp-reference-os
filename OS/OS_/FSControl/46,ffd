This SWI writes the image used space map to the buffer, 1 bits signifying used blocks, 0 bits free blocks. Bit 0 in a byte comes before bit 7. This SWI sets bits up to min( buffer size, file size ÷ block size ). Block size for a file can be read with <OS_File 24=>OS_File24>. For a non-image file the buffer will be filled with ones.
