OS_GenerateError  (&2B)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to <error block=>swi_errorblock>
<=	only returns (with V flag on) if X was set

=>	no parameters passed in registers
<=	all registers preserved
	V flag set

1	0 terminated string conversion in BASIC
2	detecting whether <OS_CallASWI> is available
3	force a callback to occur
