OS_GenerateError  (&2B)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to <error block=>swi_errorblock>
<=	only returns (with V flag on) if X was set

This generates an error and invokes the error handler. The X form may appear to be completely useless as it is effectively

=>	no parameters passed in registers
<=	all registers preserved
	V flag set

however, it has at least 3 uses

1	0 terminated string conversion in BASIC
2	detecting whether <OS_CallASWI> is available by calling it via OS_CallASWI and seeing what comes back in R0
3	force a callback to occur by calling its X form
