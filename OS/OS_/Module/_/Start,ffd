Module start code
#Parent OS_Module_format
=>	R0 =	pointer to command string, including module name
	R12 =	pointer to private word for preferred instance
	R14 =	not a return address
<=	should not return - call <OS_Exit> or start another application

This entry is called when started using <OS_Module 2=>OS_Module2>. If your module is a module task which requires application space ({/}e.g.{/} it is written in C) then you must claim <Service_Memory=>service_11> to prevent the Wimp setting the application memory for your task to 0. This instantiation *is* the preferred instatiation.

If the value for start code doesn't represent a valid non-zero offset, it is taken to be a literal ARM instruction (which hopefully is a branch to the right place).
# Gerph> I contest that the command string does NOT contain the module name
