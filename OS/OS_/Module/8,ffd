OS_Module 8
=>	R0 =	8 (reason code)

<=	R0 preserved

This gives each instantiation of all modules in turn, from the end of the module list and working backwards, a non-fatal finalisation call.

Instantiations of a particular module are killed in the order they appear on the current instantiation list.

If it succeeds, it collects the RMA together into one large unfragmented block and reinitialises the modules again. Any private words containing pointer to workspace blocks in RMA are relocated.

{*}Note:{*} This is NOT recommended.
