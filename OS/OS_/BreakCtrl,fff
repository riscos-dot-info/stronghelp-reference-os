OS_BreakCtrl  (&18)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	address of the register save block, 0 to read
	R1 =	address of the control routine, 0 to read

<=	R0 =	address of previous register save block
	R1 =	address of previous control routine
	V is always clear

This sets up the address of the BreakPoint handler and the register save block, zero for either value meaning no change - hence you can read the current value. This call is obsolete, <OS_ChangeEnvironment> provides the same, in fact OS_BreakCtrl calls this and should therefore be used in preference.
