OS_ChangeDynamicArea  (&2A)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	<area=>OS_Areas> to alter
	R1 =	amount to move in bytes (signed integer)

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	amount the area has changed by ({*}unsigned{*})

Let you enlarge (R1 positive) or shrink (R1 negative) the selected area.

If you need to release as much space as possible from an area, try to reduce its size by 16 MBytes.

Note, that normally this cannot be used while the application work area is being used; main purpose is for the OS, modules and utilities. This SWI issues <upcall Memory moving (257)=>OS_UpCall257>; if the upcall is claimed when an application is running in the application workspace then the memory movement is allowed.
