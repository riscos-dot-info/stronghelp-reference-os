OS_CallBack  (&15)
#Parent OS_
{*}This SWI is obsolete.{*} Use <OS_ChangeEnvironment> instead.

=>	R0 =	address of the register save block, 0 to read
	R1 =	address of the callback handler, 0 to read

<=	R0 =	address of previous register save block
	R1 =	address of previous callback handler

This sets up the address of the CallBack handler and the register save block, zero for either value meaning no change - hence you can read the current value. For information on callbacks refer to <OS_AddCallBack>. Internally, OS_CallBack just calls <OS_ChangeEnvironment>.
