OS_CRC  (&5B)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	CRC continuation value, or 0
	R1 =	pointer to start of block
	R2 =	pointer to end of block
	R3 =	Increment

<=	R0 =	CRC value

Calculate the Cyclic-Redundancy Check for a block of data. The value calculated is only 16 bit.

#tab
Note:	The SWI adds R3 to R1 until it equals R2, ie if R1 never equals R2 you have an infinite loop.
Note2:	The byte at R2 is not included in the CRC value.
