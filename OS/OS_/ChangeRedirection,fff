OS_ChangeRedirection  (&5E)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	new file handle for input
	 	0 = not redirected
	 	-1 = read
	R1 =	new file handle for output
	 	0 = not redirected
	 	-1 = read

<=	R0 =	old file handle for input (or 0 for standard input)
	R1 =	old file handle for output (or 0 for standard output)

This reads or writes the file handles used by <OS_CLI> to redirect in/output. It is mainly provided for the use of the TaskWindow, but you may also find the call useful. Calling <OS_Exit> automatically removes any redirection (and closes the associated file handles) before control passes to the <exit handler=>OS_handlers_exit>.
# N> Bah.
# Gerph> Yes, I noticed that whilst writing squiggly pipes.
#        It means that you can't usefully have two programs called with
#        redirection and makes the feature almost useless.
