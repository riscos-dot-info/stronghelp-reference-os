Create sprite (15)
#Parent OS_SpriteOp_Reason
=>	R0 =	<15, &F=>os_spriteop_reason2> (Create sprite)
	R1 =	<Sprite area=>os_spriteop_area>
	R2 =	Sprite name/pointer
	R3 =	0 => Exclude palette
	 	1 => Include palette
	R4 =	Width in pixels
	R5 =	Height in pixels
	R6 =	Mode number, or <sprite type=>OS_SpriteOp_Type>

This creates a blank sprite.

For a 256 entry palette on an 8bpp sprite, set bit 31 of R3. Otherwise a 64 entry VIDC1 compatible palette is assumed.

When opting to include a palette, note that the palette used is derived from the first N colours of the current screen mode. Therefore, the result is only sensible when in the same screen mode as the sprite being created for - where different, exclude the palette at the creation step and make a subsequent call to <OS_SpriteOp 37=>os_spriteop_37> for the palette.
