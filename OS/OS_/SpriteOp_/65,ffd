#Parent OS_SpriteOp_Reason
=>	R0 =	<65, &41=>os_spriteop_reason2> (Tile sprite scaled)
	R1 =	<Sprite area=>os_spriteop_area>
	R2 =	Sprite name/pointer
	R3 =	x origin (BLHC)
	R4 =	y origin (BLHC)
	R5 =	<Plot action=>os_spriteop_action>
	R6 =	<Scale factors=>os_scalefactors>, or 0 for 1:1 scaling
	R7 =	<Pixel translation table=>colourtrans_pixtrans>, or 0 for no translation

This tiles the given sprite within the graphics window, which has the advantage of only validating the sprite once for multiple output. It may also optionally be passed to graphics hardware to plot faster.

Requires SpriteExtend 1.74.
