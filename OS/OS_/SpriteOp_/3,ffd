	R2 =	pointer to filename

This SWI plots the first sprite in the file in the bottom left of the graphics window. Changes mode if neccessary, and sets palette if there is any.

Note: On RO3.5 and later, this call will load the image at the bottom left of the screen. Earlier versions of RISC OS will load the image to the screen origin.
