Initialise area  (9)
#Parent OS_SpriteOp_Reason
=>	R0 =	<9, &9=>OS_spriteop_reason2> (Initialise area)
	R1 =	<Sprite area=>OS_SpriteOp_Area>

This SWI clears all sprites from the sprite area specified by setting the number of sprites to 0 (at +4) and copying the first sprite pointer (at +8) to the first free pointer (at +12). 

Therefore to start using a sprite area, assuming no extension area, call this SWI having set the <area block=>OS_SpriteOp_Area> to:
+0	Size of area in bytes
+8	16
