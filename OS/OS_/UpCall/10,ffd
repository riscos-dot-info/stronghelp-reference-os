OS_UpCall 10 - Stream Created
#Parent OS_UpcallReasons
=>	R0 =	10 (Stream created)
	R1 =	device driver's handle
	R2 =	0 if created for reception (else created for transmission)
	R3 =	file handle for stream
	R4 =	DeviceFS stream handle, as passed to device driver on initialisation
   
<=	All registers preserved

DeviceFS issues this call when a stream is created. It serves as a broadcast, and all registers should be preserved.

This call is never issued under RISC OS 2.
