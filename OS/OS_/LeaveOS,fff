OS_LeaveOS  (&7C) (5.0+)
#Parent OS_
This SWI returns the processor to User mode. Interrupt and Fast Interrupt status is unaltered.

The advantage of OS_LeaveOS is that it will cause callbacks to occur which can massively improve applications where only a quick bit of work is required in supervisor mode, yet it may be some time before any callbacks are triggered.

#Line
The CallASWI module (version 0.03) allows this SWI to be used with RISC OS pre 5.00.
