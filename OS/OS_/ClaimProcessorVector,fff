OS_ClaimProcessorVector  (&69) (3.50+)
#Parent OS_
{*}On claim :{*}
=>	R0 =	<Vector number=>.vectors> + 256
	R1 =	Address of replacement routine
<=	R1 =	Address of original routine

{*}On release :{*}
=>	R0 =	<Vector number=>.vectors>
	R1 =	Address of original routine
	R2 =	Address of our routine (??)

This call is used to allow low-level code to claim the ARM's hardware vectors which are called when interrupts and aborts occur.
