OS_ClaimProcessorVector  (&69) (3.50+)
#Parent OS_
{*}On claim :{*}
=>	R0 =	<Vector number=>.vectors> + 256
	R1 =	Address of replacement routine
<=	R1 =	Address of original routine

{*}On release :{*}
=>	R0 =	<Vector number=>.vectors>
	R1 =	Address of original routine
	R2 =	Address of your routine

This call is used to allow low-level code to claim the ARM's hardware vectors which are called when interrupts and aborts occur.

The address off your routine must be provided on release to ensure claims and releases happen in the correct order. If the address currently on the vector differs from that in R2, an error is returned.
