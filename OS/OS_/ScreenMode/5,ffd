If cleaning is not suspended via <OS_ScreenMode 4=>OS_screenmode4>, and a clean is needed, cleans the screen immediately, and cancels any pending VSync clean. Other, does nothing.

Applications are unlikely to need to use this reason code. The Ursula Window Manager automatically deals with screen cleaning at the end of standard redraw transactions.
