If a clean is needed, cleans the screen immediately and cancels any pending VSync clean. Otherwise, does nothing. The clean happens even if cleaning is suspended via  <OS_ScreenMode 4=>OS_screenmode4>.

Non-desktop applications such as games may find this reason code useful. Typically, they would suspend screen cleaning via <OS_ScreenMode 4=>OS_screenmode4> to stop kernel background cleaning on VSyncs, while retaining the performance of a cached screen. They can then use <OS_ScreenMode 6=>OS_screenmode6> to clean the screen as necessary.
