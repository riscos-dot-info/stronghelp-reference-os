=>	R0-R7 =	APCS registers as required by <routine=>OS_HALRoutine>
	R8 =	<reason code=>.HALreason> (bits 0-7) and flags (bits 8-31)
	R9 =	<hardware call number=>OS_HALEntries>
<=	depends on flags

This SWI is only available on machines running with a hardware abstraction layer allowing them to run on machines not based around Acorn custom chips.

#Line
0	Call hardware call number given in R9. The hardware abstraction layer doesn't return errors itself with the V flag set, any error will be marked in some call specific way in R0-R3
	<= R0-R3 =	updated by call
	<= R4-R9 =	preserved
1	Get routine address for <hardware call number=>OS_HALEntries> given in R9
	<= R0 =	routine address
	<= R1 =	static base value for routine
