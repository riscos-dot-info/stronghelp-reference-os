=>	R0 =	logical colour
	R1 =	type of colour

<=	R2 =	setting of first flashing colour
	R3 =	setting of second flashing colour

This reads the setting of a particular colour that is sent to the hardware. R1 selects whether the normal colour (16), border colour (24) or pointer colour (25) is read. If R2 = R3 on exit the colour requested is a non flashing colour. The values are to interpret as follows:

#Tab

#Line
0-6	Value showing how colour was programmed
7	Supremacy bit
8-15	Amount of red
16-23	Amount of green
24-31	Amount of blue
