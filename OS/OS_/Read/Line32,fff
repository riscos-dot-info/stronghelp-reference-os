OS_ReadLine32  (&7D) (5.00+)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	buffer
	R1 =	size of buffer
	R2 =	lowest char allowed
	R3 =	highest char allowed
	R4 =	<flags=>.flags> and character to output in bottom byte (if bit 30 set)

<=	R0 corrupted
	R1 =	chars read, excluding Return
	R2 corrupted
	R3 corrupted
	C set if Escape

This SWI reads a line from the current input stream. Input is terminated with Return, Ctrl-J or Escape. Delete and Backspace deletes last char entered. Ctrl-U empties buffer.

When the buffer is full, each successive attempt to enter a character results in a Ctrl-G 'beep'.

The CallASWI module (version 0.03) allows this SWI to be used with RISC OS pre 5.00.
