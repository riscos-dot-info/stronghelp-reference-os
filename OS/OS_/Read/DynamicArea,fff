This SWI reads the size of an area.

#wrap on
/Virtualise/	If this SWI is used on an area that has virtual memory active this SWI reads the
logical size of the area, otherwise the behaviour is the same as before.
In practice this means that this call can be used by the application
without worrying whether virtual memory is active.
