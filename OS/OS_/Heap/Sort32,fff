#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	number of elements
	R1 =	pointer to word-array
	R2 =	<type=>os_heapsort1> or <comparison routine=>os_heapsort2>
	R7 =	<flags=>os_heapsort0>
optional :
	R3 =	workspace pointer
	R4 =	array of actual objects
	R5 =	size of object in R4
	R6 =	workspace of R5 bytes (if R5>16K)

This SWI sorts a list of objects, using the Heap Sort algorithm. 

The CallASWI module (version 0.03) allows this SWI to be used with RISC OS pre 5.00. See also <OS_HeapSort>.
