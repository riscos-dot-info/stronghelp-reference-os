OS_File 20, 21, 22 and 23

Read catalogue info for named stamped object

=>	R0 =	20, 21, 22 or 23
	R1 =	pointer to filename
	 	if R0 = 20 :	use File$Path
	 	if R0 = 21 :	R4 = pointer to path string
	 	if R0 = 22 :	R4 = pointer to path variable
	 	if R0 = 23 :	use no path

<=	R0 =	<object type=>fsys_objtype>
	R2 =	<load address=>fsys_loadexec>, without top three bytes /if/ file is typed
	R3 =	<exec address=>fsys_loadexec>
	R4 =	object length
	R5 =	<object attributes=>fsys_objattr>
	R6 =	<filetype=>Filetypes:!Root>	(images and directories report as &1000,
	 	 				 applications as &2000, untyped files as -1)

PRM doesn't say so, but it would be wise to assume R2-R6 corrupted if object not found.
