OS_GBPB  10
#Parent OS_GBPB
=>	R0 =	10
	R1 =	pointer to directory name
	R2 =	pointer to <buffer=>OS_GBPB10buffer>
	R3 =	number of objects to read
	R4 =	where to start, 0 first time
	R5 =	length of buffer
	R6 =	wildcarded name to match (if 0 "*" is used)
<=	R3 =	number of objects read
	R4 =	where to continue, or -1 for no more
	C flag is clear if R3 = 0, else it is set

This SWI reads entries from the specified directory. The correct code structure to call this SWI is:

#fCode
repeat
\{
  call OS_GBPB 10
  if (R3 \<> 0)
  \{
    process buffer
  }
} until (R4 = -1)
#f

as it is legal to return R3 = 0 before the end of the directory. Also, do *not* assume anything about the value in R4 - Filer_Action assumes that it increases by one for each entry read and comes horribly unstuck.
# Nick> Note: The PRM lies when it says that if R6 points to an empty string
#       "*" is used.
# Gerph> It's possible that this was the case on RO2. It has not been observed
#        recently. It might require some testing to find out...
