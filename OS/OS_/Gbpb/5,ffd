OS_GBPB 5, 6 and 7
#Parent OS_GBPB
=>	R0 =	5, 6 or 7
	R2 =	buffer

<=	R0, R2 preserved
	C flag corrupted

These calls read information on the temporary filing system (normally the current) to the buffer pointed to by R2.
If R0 = 5 :
#Indent 2
\<name length byte>\<disc name>\<boot option byte>
of disc containing the current directory
#Indent

If R0 = 6 :
#Indent 2
\<0>\<name length byte>\<current directory name>\<priviliged byte>
of the currently selected directory. The priviliged byte is either &00 ie allowance to create or delete objects in the directory &FF ie prohibition of creating or deleting objects; in ADFS or other FileCore based systems, you always got &00
#Indent
If R0 = 7 :
#Indent 2
\<0>\<name length byte>\<library directory name>\<priviliged byte>
of the library directory
#Indent

The names are stored without termination byte.
