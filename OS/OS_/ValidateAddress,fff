OS_ValidateAddress  (&3A)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	minimum address
	R1 =	maximum address

<=	R0,R1 preserved
	C flag is clear if the range is OK, set otherwise

SWI checks the address range between R0 and R1-1 to see if the specified range lies in <logical RAM=>Machine:Logical> and has a mapping into physical RAM.

Note: This does /not/ check that the memory actually exists, only that it ought to exist. If you have used <OS_SetMemMapEntries>, then this call will not work as expected.
