OS_IICOp  (&7B) (5.00+)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to an array of <I²C transfer descriptors=>.iic_transfer>
	R1 =	b0-23	number of descriptors
	 	b24-31	bus number

Reads from or writes to the specified I²C device on the specified bus.

This is a more powerful version of <IIC_Control> which can only address bus 0, and doesn't support repeated starts. On RISC OS 5 <IIC_Control> internally calls OS_IICOp.
