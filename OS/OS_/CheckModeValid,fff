OS_CheckModeValid  (&3F)
#Parent !Root
=>	R0 =	<mode number=>VDU:22a> to check

<=	if C flag unset mode is valid and R0 preserved
	if C flag set the mode is invalid
	R0 =	-1 if mode is non-existent
	 	-2 if not enough memory
	R1 =	mode that would be used
	 	-2 if unable to select alternative mode

This finds out, whether you may change to a given mode or its invalid, either because the monitor type forbids it, R1 then is the alternative mode, or there's not enough memory in this case R1 = -2.
