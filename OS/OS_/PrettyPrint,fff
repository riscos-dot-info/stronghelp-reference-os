OS_PrettyPrint  (&44)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to null terminated string to write
	R1 =	pointer to dictionary (0 = <RISC OS dictionary=>.ROD>)
	R2 =	pointer to null terminated special string
<=	R0-R2 preserved

This call acts like <OS_Write0> with several differences:
#Tab;Indent 2
è	It will break a line at a space if the next word will not fit on the line, except at hard spaces
è	Compacted text is handled
è	CR causes a newline to be generated
è	TAB causes a tabulation to the next multiple of eight columns
è	ASCII 31 is a hard space
è	ESC (ASCII 27) indicates that a dictionary entry should be substituted
#Indent

Compacted text uses an escape character in the print string to indicate a dictionary entry. It is followed immediately by a byte which is the dictionary entry number. If this byte is in the range 1-255, then the appropriate string in the dictionary is subsituted. If its 0, then the special string pointed to by R2 is subsituted. (This is used in particular by the *Help command.)

The format of an dictionary is a linear list of entries, which can recursively refer to other dictionary entries; each entry is a length byte followed by a 0 terminated string. This means that a dictionary doesn't have to have 255 entries - it can be ended at a point with a zero length entry.
