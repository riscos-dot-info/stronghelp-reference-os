OS_PlatformFeatures 0 (&6D)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	0 (Read code features) + flags (reserved)
<=	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R1 =	pointer to IRQ routine (if b1 set)

This reason is used to determine what is required to run code on the current platform.

StrongARM will return bits 0-4 set.
ARM 6 and 7 with return bits 0-4 clear.
Earlier machines will raise an error.
#
#Subpage flags
PlatformFeatures 0 flags
Bit	Meaning if set
#Line
0	You must tell the OS when a code area changes (<OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas>)
1	Enabling then disabling interrupts does *not* allow them a chance to occur
2	Hardware vectors are only readable in 32 bit mode
3	When storing PC, PC+8 is stored (not PC+12)
4	Data aborts occur with 'full early' timing
5	CPU has separate I and D caches
6	Operating system executes in 32 bit mode
7	26 bit mode is not available
8	Processor is M class (supports UMULL etc)
9	Processor supports Thumb
10	Processor is E class (supports QADD etc)
11-14	Reserved
15	CPU supports extended small page L2 descriptors
16	CPU doesn‘t have a Drain Write Buffer instruction 
17	Aborts don‘t correctly follow the documented abort model (e.g. StrongARM pre rev-T; prevents lazy task swapping from being used) 
18	CPU is an XScale 
19	XScale JTAG is connected 
20	High processor vectors are in use (vectors at &FFFF0000 instead of &0) 
21-31	Reserved for future expansion
