#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	32 (Read vector base) + flags (reserved)
<=	R0 =	address of ARM processor vectors
	R1 =	space reserved for ARM processor vectors

This reason is used to determine the size and address of the ARM vectors. Historically these values would be 256 and &00000000 respectively, the values are only likely to be of interest to authors of FIQ handlers.
