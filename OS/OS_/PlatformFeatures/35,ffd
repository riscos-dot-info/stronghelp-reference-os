=>	R0 =	35 (Read address of clear exclusive monitor)
<=	R1 =	pointer to clear exclusive routine, or 0 if not required

This reason is used to get the address of a routine to call that will reset/unlock the exclusive monitor implemented with LDREX/STREX and similar family of instructions. On a CPU that doesn't support these, zero is returned.

Use this in preference to your own code so that any changes to the ARM architecture or bugs in the CPU can be updated centrally.
