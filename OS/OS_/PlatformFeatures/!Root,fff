OS_PlatformFeatures  (&6D) (3.70+)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	reason code, and reason dependant flags
	 	0	<Read code features=>OS_PlatformFeatures0>
	 	1	Read MMU features
	 	32	<Read vectors base=>OS_PlatformFeatures32>
	 	33	<Read cache information=>OS_PlatformFeatures33>

This SWI is used to find out what features the executing platform has, if any.

Note that a stack imbalance meant that attempting to query subreasons other than 0 would cause an error even if the X bit in the SWI number was set, this bug was fixed when subreason 32 was added. Therefore, before trying nonzero subreasons check bit 31 of subreason 0 to be sure the bug is fixed.
#line
Subreason 0 is provided by RISC OS 3.70+, and also the CallASWI module for earlier versions of RISC OS.
