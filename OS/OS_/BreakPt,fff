OS_BreakPt  (&17)
#Parent OS_
When this is executed, all user mode registers are saved into a block and the <BreakPoint handler=>OS_handlers_breakpoint> is called. The saved registers are only guaranteed to be correct for user mode. The default handler displays the message 'Break point at &xxxxx' and calls <OS_Exit>. This SWI would be placed in code by the debugger at required breakpoints.

The handler can be changed with <OS_ChangeEnvironment>.
