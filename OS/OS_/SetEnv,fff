OS_SetEnv  (&12)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	address of the handler for <OS_Exit>, 0 to read
	R1 =	address of the memory limit for <OS_GetEnv>, 0 to read
	R4 =	address for undefined instructions, 0 to read
	R5 =	address for prefetch abort, 0 to read
	R6 =	address for handler for data abort, 0 to read
	R7 =	address for handler for address exceptions, 0 to read

<=	The used registers contain the previous handlers.

This sets several handlers, better use <OS_ChangeEnvironment>, because this call is obsolete and uses this newer version.
