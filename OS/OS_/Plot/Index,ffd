The base commands are specified in the top 5 bits, modified by the <value in the bottom 3 bits =>OS_PlotModifiers>. Block copy/move uses a <special set of modifiers =>OS_PlotBlockModifiers>.

Some shapes need to be defined by a sequence of points. The VDU drivers use the previous positions of the graphics cursor to define these. These can be specified by a sequence of absolute or relative moves (commands 64 or 68) - the points to visit to define a particular shape is given as a link in the table above.

Unknown plot codes (216-231,240-255) are sent to the <unknown plot vector=>vector_ukplotv>, which by default does nothing.

The dash pattern is set with <VDU 23,6=>VDU:23,6> and can be read with <OS_Word 10,6=>OS_Word10>. Its length is set and read with <OS_Byte 163=>OS_Byte163>.
#SubPage line
Line Moves
To plot a line, move to one endpoint, then plot line to other endpoint
#SubPage triangle
Triangle Moves
To plot a triangle, move to vertex, move to next vertex, then plot triangle to third vertex.
#SubPage rectangle
Rectangle Moves
To plot a rectangle, move to one corner, then plot rectangle to diagonally opposite corner.
#SubPage parallelogram
Parallelogram Moves
To plot a parallelogram, move to vertex, move to next vertex, then plot parallelogram to third vertex. Fourth vertex will be opposite second.
#SubPage circle
Circle Moves
To plot a circle, move to centre, then plot circle to a point on the circumference.
#SubPage arc/segment/sector
Arc/Segment/Sector Moves
To plot an arc/segment/sector, move to centre, move to start, then plot arc/segment/sector to a point on the line joining centre to end. Arc/segment/sector will be plotted anticlockwise.
#SubPage copy/move
Block Copy/Move Moves
First define the source rectangle: move to one corner, then move to diagonally opposite corner. Then plot bottom left corner of destination.
#SubPage ellipse
Ellipse Moves
To plot a ellipse, move to centre, move to point on circumference with same Y coord as centre, then plot ellipse to the lowest or highest point on the circumference.
