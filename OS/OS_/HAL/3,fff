HAL Entry 3
#Parent OS_HALEntries
void HAL_IRQClear(int device)
#Line
Clears the specified IRQ source, if it is latched in the interrupt controller, rather than the device. For certain low-level devices, such as the timer, the interrupt must be cleared with this call, however the hardware is implemented.
