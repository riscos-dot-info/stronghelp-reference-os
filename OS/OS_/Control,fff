OS_Control  (&0F)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	address of error handler, or 0 to read
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for the error handler, or 0 to read
	R2 =	address of escape state change handler, or 0 to read
	R3 =	address of event handler, or 0 to read       
   
<=	R0 =	previous error handler address
	R1 =	previous buffer address
	R2 =	previous escape routine address
	R3 =	previous event handler address

This sets some of the exception handlers, but is obsolete and shouldn't be used in newer programs, because <OS_ChangeEnvironment> does the same, in fact OS_Control uses it.
