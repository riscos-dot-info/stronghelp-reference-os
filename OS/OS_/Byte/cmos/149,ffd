OS_Byte CMOS 149-152
#Parent OS_ByteCMOS
The 4 BASIC editor bytes should be regarded as a big endian word, MSB in CMOS byte 149.

Bit(s)	Meaning
#Line
0-2	Foreground colour
3	set => Auto indent
4-6	Background colour
7	set => Insert
8-15	Mode (16 colours or less)
16-21	Tab length
22,23	?
# Hmm. Now that I've figured out how the checksum works, maybe I should
# experiment and see what these two bits do.
24	set => steady cursor
27-31	Checksum

Checksum is {fCode}NOT{f} (number of bits set in bits 0-26). If the checksum is invalid the BASIC editor defaults to &C300CF.
# BASIC Editor as covered by good old RISC OS 2 copyright, so you are allowed
# to disassemble it. The code to calculate the checksum could be 1 instruction
# shorter if the EOR #31; MOV is replaced with a MVN. There may be other
# savings to make.
