OS_Byte 177  Read input source

	R1 =	0

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	<value of stream selection=>OS_Byteinputsources>
	R2 corrupted

This returns the number of the buffer from which character input gets characters (assuming Exec is not enabled  - see <OS_Byte 198=>OS_Byte198>). You *must not* use any numbers than 0 and 255 for R1 and R2 - to change this variable use <OS_Byte 2=>OS_Byte002>.
