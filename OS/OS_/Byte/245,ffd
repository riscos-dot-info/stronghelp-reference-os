OS_Byte 245  Read/Write printer driver type
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	245 (&F5)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call reads or sets the path to use for printer output. The <type=>OS_Byteprinters> may also be written with <OS_Byte 5=>OS_Byte005>. The default type is set held within <CMOS byte 15=>OS_ByteCMOS15>.

This call does not wait for the printer buffer to empty first. Because of this, it does not enable interrupts, and so may be used to read the printer type from within an interrupt routine.
