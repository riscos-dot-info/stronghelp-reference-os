OS_Byte 182  Read/Write printer NoIgnore state
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	182 (&B6)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call reads or sets the printer NoIgnore state. If bit 7 is clear then the ignore character set by <OS_Byte 6=>OS_Byte006> or <OS_Byte 246=>OS_Byte246> is filtered from the printer output stream. If bit 7 is set, then the printer stream passes all characters. The default state of this bit is stored in <CMOS byte 15=>OS_Bytecmos15>.

The default setting of this flag is controlled by <*Configure Ignore=>StarCmds:ConfIgnore> and may be changed temporarily using <*Ignore=>StarCmds:Ignore>.
