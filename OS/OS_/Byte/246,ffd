OS_Byte 246  Read/Write printer ignore character
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	246 (&F6)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call reads or set the printer ignore character. It may also be written with <OS_Byte 6=>OS_Byte006>. To unset the ignore character (NoIgnore) you cannot use this call, you need to use <OS_Byte 182=>OS_Byte182>. The default ignore character is stored in <CMOS byte 14=>OS_Bytecmos>, the NoIgnore state in <CMOS byte 15=>OS_Bytecmos15> and can be set with <*Configure Ignore=>StarCmds:ConfIgnore>.

This is equivilent to <*Ignore n=>StarCmds:Ignore>.
