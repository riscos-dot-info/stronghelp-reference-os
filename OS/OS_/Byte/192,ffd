OS_Byte 192  Read serial port state
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	192 (&C0)
	R1 =	0
	R2 =	255

<=	R0 =	preserved
	R1 =	communications state
	R2 =	flash counter (see <OS_Byte 193=>OS_Byte193>)
                                                  
This call reads the serial port state - equivalent to a read operation with <OS_Byte 156=>OS_Byte156>. It is provided for backwards compatibility - use <OS_SerialOp 0 and 1=>OS_SerialOp> instead. This call should not be used to write the value - doing so would make the value in memory inconsistent with the hardware.
