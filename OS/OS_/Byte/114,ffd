OS_Byte 114  Write shadow/non-shadow state
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	114
	R1 =	0	modes will be shadow
	 	1	modes will be non-shadow

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous shadow sate
	R2 corrupted

This call determines whether future <mode changes=>VDU:22> will be forced to use shadow state. <OS_Byte 112=>OS_Byte112> and <113=>OS_Byte113> control the use of shadow banks.

Shadow state requires twice the amount of RAM than the equivalent non-shadow mode since two copies of the screen are stored in memory.
