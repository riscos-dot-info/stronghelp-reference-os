OS_Byte 199  Read/Write *Spool file handle
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	199
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous file handle
	R2 corrupted

This call reads or sets the {fCode}<*Spool=>StarCmds:Spool>{f} file handle. A handle of 0 means that spooling is disabled, a non-zero handle means that spooling is enabled (unless disabled with <OS_Byte 3=>OS_Byte003>). Changing the spool handle to an invalid file handle can really ruin your day (every call to <OS_WriteC> {/}etc.{/} will return an error, including the calls used to report the error to screen...).
