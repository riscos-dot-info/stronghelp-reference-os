OS_Byte 145  Get char from buffer
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	145 (&91)
	R1 =	<buffer number=>Buffer_buffers>

<=	R0, R1 preserved
	R2 =	byte removed
	C flag	set if buffer was empty on entry
	 	clear if byte was successfully removed
                                                  
This call extracts the next byte from the given buffer. The buffer number is *not* validated - undefined results (rather than an error) occur if a bad buffer number is passed.
