OS_Byte 6  Write printer ignore character
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	6
	R1 =	ASCII code of ignore character

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous ignore character
	R2 corrupted

This call writes the printer ignore character. It may be read (and written) with <OS_Byte 246=>OS_Byte246>. To unset the ignore character (NoIgnore) you cannot use this call, you need to use <OS_Byte 182=>OS_Byte182>. The state can also be changed by <*Ignore=>StarCmds:Ignore>.

The default ignore character is stored in <CMOS byte 14=>OS_Bytecmos>, the NoIgnore state in <CMOS byte 15=>OS_Bytecmos15> and both can be controlled with <*Configure Ignore=>StarCmds:ConfIgnore>.
