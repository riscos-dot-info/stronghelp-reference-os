OS_Byte 128  Get buffer/mouse status
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	128
	R1 =	<reason code=>.reason>

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	bits 0-7 give LSB of answer
	R2 =	bits 0-23 give bits 8-31 of answer

This call checks the (buffered) mouse position or the free space in system buffers, depending on the reason code passed in R1. It is recommended to use <OS_Mouse> to read the mouse position, as this reads the current (unbuffered) position.

7		mouse x
8		mouse y
246		free bytes in mouse buffer
252		free bytes in printer buffer
253		free bytes in serial output buffer
254		free bytes in serial input buffer
255		free bytes in keyboard buffer

Note that for reading free space, R1 = 255 - <buffer number=>Buffer_buffers>.
