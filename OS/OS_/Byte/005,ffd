OS_Byte 5  Write printer driver type
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	5
	R1 =	printer driver <type=>OS_Byteprinters>

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous printer driver type
	R2 corrupted

This call determines the path to use for printer output. The type may be read (and written) with <OS_Byte 245=>OS_Byte245>. The default type is set held within <CMOS byte 15=>OS_ByteCMOS15> and <*Configure Print=>StarCmds:CPrint>.

If a serial printer is in use, setting bit 0 in <OS_Byte 3=>os_byte003> will mean that the characters are printed twice.
