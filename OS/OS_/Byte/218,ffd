OS_Byte 218  Read/Write bytes in VDU queue
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	218 (&DA)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous count
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call reads or sets the count of bytes in the VDU queue. The value of the count is {fCode}-(bytes needed to complete <VDU sequence=>VDU:!Root>){f} held in 1 byte, so if two bytes are needed to complete the current sequence then count will be &FE.

Usually this call is used to set the count to 0, which abandons any current VDU sequence. This stops error messages being garbled by a partially completed VDU sequence.
