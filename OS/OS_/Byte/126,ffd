OS_Byte 126  Acknowledge escape condition
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	126 (&7E)

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	0 if no escape condition
	 	255 if escape condition cleared
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call attempts to clear an escape condition. If an escape condition exists, it performs the escape condition side effects if these have been enabled with <OS_Byte 230=>OS_Byte230>, and then calls the <escape handler=>OS_handlers_escape> to indicate that the escape has been cleared.
