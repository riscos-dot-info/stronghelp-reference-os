This call reads and changes the result of pressing Break. The value byte alters Break and modifiers of it as follows:

#Tab
Bits	Key combination
#Line
0,1	Break
2,3	Shift Break
4,5	Ctrl Break
6,7	Ctrl Shift Break

Each two bit numbers can mean one of these:

Value	Meaning
#Line
00	Act as reset
01	Act as escape key
10	No effect
11	undefined

The default is %00000001, so Break causes an escape condition, together with Shift and/or Ctrl it acts like the reset button. Please note that this SWI also alters the CMOS when writing a new status.
#Line
