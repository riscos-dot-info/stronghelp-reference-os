OS_Byte 200  Alter Break and Escape effect
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	200 (&C8)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 =	preserved
	R1 =	state before being overwritten
	R2 =	keyboard disable flag (see <OS_Byte 201=>OS_Byte201>)
                                                  
This call can read, or change, the effects of a reset (including resets caused by Break) and of Escape.

The bottom two bits of R1 have the following significance:

#Tab
Bit	Value	Effect
#line
0	0	Normal escape action
	1	Escape disabled unless caused by <OS_Byte 125=>OS_Byte125>
1	0	Normal reset action
	1	Power on reset (only if bits 2-7 of R1 are zero) This means a value of %00000001x causes a memory clear (no matter what kind of reset was pressed)
#Line
