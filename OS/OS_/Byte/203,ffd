#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	203 (&CB)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 =	serial ignore flag (see <OS_Byte 204=>OS_Byte204>)
                                                  
This call reads or sets the serial buffer threshold. While the free space is below this value the serial harware will attempt to halt incoming data. <OS_SerialOp 0=>OS_SerialOp0> controls the handshaking method. The default threshold is 9 characters.
