OS_Byte 250  Read VDU driver screen bank number
#Parent OS_ByteIndex

	R1 =	0
	R2 =	255

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	VDU driver screen bank
	R2 =	display screen bank (see <OS_Byte 251=>OS_Byte251>)

This call reads the screen bank used by the display, as set with <OS_Byte 112=>OS_Byte112>. This call should not be used to write the value - doing so would only change the value in memory, without affecting the hardware.
