Output stream status
#Parent OS_Byte003
Bit	Stream affected
#Line
0	Enables serial driver
1	Disables VDU drivers
2	Disables VDU printer stream
3	Enables printer (regardless of VDU state)
4	Disables spooled output
5	Calls <VDUXV=>Vector_vduxv> instead of VDU drivers
6	Disables printer, except for <VDU 1,n=>VDU:1>
7	Not used

Bit 1 is not the same as <VDU 21=>VDU:21> - with VDU 21 bytes are still sent to the printer if it has been enables with <VDU 2=>VDU:2>.

Bit 3 is not the same as <VDU 2=>VDU:2> - when set (and bits 2 and 6 clear!) *all* bytes except the printer ignore character (see <OS_Byte 6=>OS_Byte006>) are sent to the printer stream.
