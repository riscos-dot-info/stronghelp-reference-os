OS_Byte 124  Clear escape condition
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	124 (&7C)

<=	R0 preserved
	R1,R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call clears any escape condition by calling the <escape handler=>OS_handlers_escape> with R11=0, then returns. (Unless you read page 1-848 of the PRM, which says that it doesn't call the escape handler.)
