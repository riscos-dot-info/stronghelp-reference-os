OS_Byte 118  Reflect keyboard status in LEDs
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	118

<=	R0 preserved
	R1,R2 corrupted

The settings of Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and Num Lock are held in a location referred to as the keyboard status byte. See <OS_Byte 202=>OS_Byte202> for details of this. Under normal circumstances they are shown by the LEDs on the keyboard, but these are not updated when the status is changed using OS_Byte 202. This call ensures that the current contents of the keyboard status byte are reflected in the LEDs.
