#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	254 (&FE)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call allows you to enable or disable the effect of Shift and Ctrl on the numeric keypad or to read the current state. These keys may modify the code just before it is inserted into the input buffer.

If R1 is zero, then Shift and Ctrl are enabled. Any non-zero value will disable them. This is the default.

#Tab
If Shift/Ctrl are enabled, then the following action occur depending on the value generated by a keypad key:

* key value >=&80	:	Shift exclusive ORs the value with &10 Ctrl  exclusive ORs the value with &20
* key value \<&80	:	Shift and Ctrl still have no effect.

If NumLock is off, then a {fCode}*Fx 254 0{f} makes the keypad to act exactly like the cursor keys, including Shift, Ctrl or both.

The base value used for numeric keypad interpretation can be read and written with <OS_Byte 238=>OS_Byte238>.
