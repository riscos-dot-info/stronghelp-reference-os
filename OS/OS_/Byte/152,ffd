OS_Byte 152  Examine status of a buffer
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	152 (&98)
	R1 =	<buffer number=>Buffer_buffers>

<=	R0, R1 preserved
	R2 =	next byte in buffer, corrupted if buffer empty
	C flag	set if buffer is empty, otherwise clear
                                                  
This call checks whether a given buffer is empty, and if a byte is available returns it without removing it from the buffer. The buffer number is *not* validated - undefined results (rather than an error) occur if a bad buffer number is passed.
