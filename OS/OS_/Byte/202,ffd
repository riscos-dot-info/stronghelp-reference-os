The keyboard status byte holds information on the current status of the keyboard, such as the setting of Caps Lock. This call enables you to read and change these settings. Note that this call does not update the LEDs. If you don't stamp this state with <OS_Byte 118=>OS_Byte118>, the LEDs won't be switched on or off. The default state of Caps Lock is stored in <CMOS byte 11=>OS_Bytecmos11>.
