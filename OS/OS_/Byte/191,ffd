OS_Byte 191  Read/Write serial busy flag
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	191 (&BF)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 =	serial port state (see <OS_Byte 192=>OS_Byte192>)
                                                  
This call is obsolete - on the BBC/Master 128 the cassette interface and RS423 serial port shared hardware. It performs no useful function under RiscOS.
