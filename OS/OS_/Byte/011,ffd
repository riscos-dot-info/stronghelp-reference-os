OS_Byte 11  Write keyboard auto repeat delay
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	11
	R1 =	delay period in centiseconds

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous delay period
	R2 corrupted

You must hold down each key on the keyboard for a number of centiseconds before it begins to autorepeat. This call enables you to change the initial delay from the default set by <*Configure Delay=>*Status Delay>, stored in <CMOS byte 12=>OS_Bytecmos>. This variable may also be read or set by <OS_Byte196>.
