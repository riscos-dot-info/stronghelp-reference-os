OS_Byte 176  Read/Write 50Hz counter
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	176 (&B0)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value before being overwritten
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call reads or sets the "50Hz" counter, a 1 byte counter which is decreased every vSync. As a consequence the rate of this counter is actually mode and monitor dependent, and should not be used for accurate timing.
