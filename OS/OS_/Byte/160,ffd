OS_Byte 160  Read VDU variable number
#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	160 (&A0)
	R1 =	<VDU variable number=>.numbers>

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	value of variable
	R2 =	value of next variable (entry R1 + 1)

This call is provided for compatibility with the BBC/Master 128, and reads various VDU variables. Note that it does not use the same numbers for variables as <OS_ReadVDUVariables>, and that that SWI can read many more variables.
