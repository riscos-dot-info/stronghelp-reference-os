#Parent OS_ByteIndex
=>	R0 =	219 (&DB)
	R1 =	EOR value
	R2 =	AND value

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	previous value
	R2 corrupted
                                                  
This call reads or sets the character that the tab key produces. If 128 <= value <= 255 then the character inserted in the buffer is modified by shift and control:
