Escape handler
#Parent OS_handlers
This is called whenever an escape condition is detected and the <escape event=>event_6> is disabled (execept for calls to <OS_Byte 125=>OS_Byte125> which always call the handler). <OS_Byte 124=>OS_Byte124> and <126=>OS_Byte126> suggest that it is also called with R11 bit 6 clear to clear/acknowledge an escape condition.

=>	R11 =	bit 6 set (implies escape condition)
	R12 =	"workspace" - don't use the value 1
	R13 =	FD stack
<=	R12 =	1 sets <callback=>.callback>
