OS_Write0  (&02)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to null-terminated string
<=	R0 =	pointer to the byte {*}after{*} the null

This SWI sends the string pointed to by R0 to all <active output streams=>OS_Byte003>. 

If <WrchV=>vector_wrchv> has not been intercepted with <OS_Claim> it will directly call the VDU driver which is faster, otherwise it calls <OS_WriteC> to write each character.
