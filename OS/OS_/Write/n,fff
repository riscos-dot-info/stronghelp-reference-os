OS_WriteN  (&46)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to string
	R1 =	number of bytes to write

This SWI sends the R1 bytes in R0 to all <active output streams=>OS_Byte003>. 

If <WrchV=>vector_wrchv> has not been intercepted with <OS_Claim> it will directly call the VDU driver which is faster, otherwise it calls <OS_WriteC> to write each character.
