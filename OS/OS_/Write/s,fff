OS_WriteS  (&01)
#Parent OS_
This SWI writes the null terminated string following this SWI in memory using <OS_WriteC>. It uses the value in R14 to find the string, and updates R14 to point after string.
This SWI can not be conditionally executed [unless the string you wish to write out also happens to be valid ARM code for the condition failed case :-) ].
# Gerph> Ok, I'd like to see someone write a piece of code that actually did
#        something useful using a conditional OS_WriteS. Any takers ?
