This call reads or writes the <input buffer threshold value=>.full>.

<OS_SerialOp 0=>OS_SerialOp0> can be used to examine or change the handshaking method.

The default value on RISC OS 3.5 is 17 characters, but this is subject to change and should not be relied upon.

This call is available in RISC OS 3.10 and later, despite its lack of inclusion in the PRM.

OS_SerialOp 8 full description
The serial input routine attempts to halt input when the amount of free space left in the input buffer falls below a certain level. This call allows the value at which input is halted to be read or changed.
