OS_SerialOp 0
=>	R0 =	0 (reason code)
	R1 =	EOR mask
	R2 =	AND mask

<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	old value of state
	R2 =	new value of state

The structure of this call is very similar to that of OS_Byte's between &A6 and &FF the new state is determined by:
  <New State=>OS_SerialOpStatus> = (Old state AND R2) EOR R1
