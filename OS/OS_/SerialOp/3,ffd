OS_SerialOp 3
=>	R0 =	3 (reason code)
	R1 =	character to be sent

<=	R0,R1 preserved
	C clear if character was sent, or set if character was not sent (ie the buffer was full)

This call puts a character in the serial output buffer, and re-enables the transmit interrupt if it had been disabled by RISC OS. If the serial output buffer is full, the call returns immediately with the C flag set.
