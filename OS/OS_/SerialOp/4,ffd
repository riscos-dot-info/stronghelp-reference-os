OS_SerialOp 4
=>	R0 =	4 (reason code)

<=	R0 preseved
	R1 =	character received (if C flag cleared), or preserved (if C flag set - ie no character available in buffer to read)

This call removes a character from the serial input buffer if one is present. If removing a character leaves the input buffer with more free space than are specified by OS_Byte 203, then the transmitting device is re-enabled in the way specified by the serial port state (as set by <OS_SerialOp 0=>OS_SerialOp0>).
