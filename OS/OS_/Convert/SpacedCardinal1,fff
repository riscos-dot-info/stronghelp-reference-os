OS_ConvertSpacedCardinal1  (&E1)
#Parent OS_Convert
=>	R0 =	value to be converted
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for resulting string
	R2 =	size of buffer

<=	R0 =	pointer to buffer (R1 on entry)
	R1 =	pointer to terminator
	R2 =	free bytes in buffer

This SWI converts a value into an unsigned string of decimal characters with space separators every thousand, though as the largest number that can be passed in 1 byte is less than a thousand it behaves identically to <OS_ConvertCardinal1>. The number can be 0 to 255 (3 characters).
