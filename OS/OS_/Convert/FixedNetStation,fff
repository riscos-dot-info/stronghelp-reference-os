=>	R0 =	pointer to <net and station number=>OS_Convertnetstationblock>
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for resulting string
	R2 =	size of buffer
<=	R0 =	pointer to buffer (R1 on entry)
	R1 =	pointer to terminator
	R2 =	free bytes in buffer

This SWI converts the network and station number to a string of the form "{/}nnn.sss{/}".

If the network is 0
	the first four characters are spaces
