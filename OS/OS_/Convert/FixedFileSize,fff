OS_ConvertFixedFileSize  (&EB)
#Parent OS_Convert
=>	R0 =	file size
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for resulting string
	R2 =	size of buffer

<=	R0 =	pointer to buffer (R1 on entry)
	R1 =	pointer to terminator
	R2 =	free bytes in buffer

This SWI converts a value to a amount of space available in the form x bytes, x kbytes, or x Mbytes. This is the fixed string length version of <OS_ConvertFileSize>, with the start padded with spaces.
