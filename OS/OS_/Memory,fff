#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	<reason code=>.reasons> (bits 0-7)
	 	and flags (bits 8-31) which are reason code specific

Peforms miscellaneous operations for memory management.

=>	R0 =	0 (reason code)
	 	and <flags=>.0flags>
	R1 =	pointer to <page block=>.pageblock>
	R2 =	number of entries in page block

This call converts between the different memory spaces used to specify addresses in a page block, and can alter their cacheability. The addresses must be in RAM, but need not be page aligned. If a page is made uncacheable, the cache will be flushed. If there is an error processing any page in the block, the call has no effect on any pages.

#Subpage 6
OS_Memory 6
=>	R0 =	6 (reason code)
	 	all flags bits reserved
<=	R1 =	table size (in bytes)
	R2 =	page size (in bytes)

This call reads the size of the physical memory arrangement table, as returned by <OS_Memory 7=>.7>
#Subpage 7
OS_Memory 7
=>	R0 =	7 (reason code)
	 	all flags bits reserved
	R1 =	pointer to table to be filled in

This call reads the physical memory arrangement table, to get the size of this table, use <OS_Memory 6=>.6>
#Subpage 8
OS_Memory 8
=>	R0 =	8 (reason code)
	 	and <flags=>.8flags>
<=	R1 =	number of pages of specified type of memory
	R2 =	page size (in bytes)

This call reads the amount of a specified type of memory available in the computer.
#Subpage 8flags

OS_Memory 9
=>	R0 =	9 (reason code)
	 	all flags bits reserved
	R1 =	<controller ID=>.9id>
<=	R1 =	controller base address, or 0 if not present

This call checks for the presence of a given controller and returns its base address if present.

Bit	Meaning
#Line
0-7	controller sequence number
8-31	controller type:
	 	0 => EASI card ECTCR (for internal use only)

#Subpage 13
OS_Memory 13 map in IO permanently (5.00+)
=>	R0 =	13 (reason code)
	 	and <flags=>.mapinflags>
	R1 =	physical address to map in
	R2 =	size to map in
<=	R3 =	logical address assigned

Permanently maps in a region of IO memory at run time.
#Subpage 14
OS_Memory 14 map in IO temporarily (5.00+)
=>	R0 =	14 (reason code)
	 	bit 8 = 1 to map bufferable space, 0 for unbufferable
	 	bits 9..31 = reserved, must be zero
	R1 =	physical address to map in
<=	R2 =	logical address assigned
	R3 =	reference key (required when releasing)

Temporarily maps in 1MByte of IO memory at run time.
If multiple 1MByte chunks are required keep calling this until done, when ready to release it is only necessary to release the {*}first{*} reference key - the kernel will then free the rest for you.
#Subpage 15
OS_Memory 15 release IO region (5.00+)
=>	R0 =	15 (reason code)
	 	all flags bits reserved
	R1 =	reference key (assigned when claimed)

Frees up a region of IO memory previously mapped in at run time.

<=	R1 =	base of area
	R2 =	address space allocated for area
	R3 =	actual memory used by area

Returns details on the selected area, rounded to a whole number of pages, or zero if not present.
