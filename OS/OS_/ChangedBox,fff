OS_ChangedBox  (&5A)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	0	disable changed box calculations
	 	1	enable changed box calculations
	 	2	reset changed box to null rectangle
	 	-1	read changed box information

<=	R0 =	previous enable state in bit 0
	R1 =	pointer to a fixed block of 5 words:
	 	0 new disable/enable flag
	 	4 x-coordinate of left edge of box
	 	8 y-coordinate of bottom edge of box
	 	12 x-coordinate of right edge of box
	 	16 y-coordinate of top edge of box

4-16 are only valid if the change box calculations were in an enabled state immediately after the call; otherwise they are undefined.

This call checks which areas of the screen were changed by VDU commands and returns the smallest rectangle which covers all changed pixels.
