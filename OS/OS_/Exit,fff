OS_Exit  (&11)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	Pointer to <error block=>swi_errorblock>
	R1 =	"ABEX" (&58454241) If Return code
	R2 =	Return code
   
<=	Never returns

This SWI passes control over to the most recent <exit handler=>OS_handlers_exit>.

If R1 = "ABEX", and 0 \<= R2 \<= Sys$RCLimit, then Sys$ReturnCode is set to R2.

If R1 = "ABEX" and R2 is outside this range, then Sys$ReturnCode is still set to R2, and a garbled error message issued (0 is used at the pointer to an error block). This is a very long lived OS bug.
