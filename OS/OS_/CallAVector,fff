=>	R0-R8 =	vector routine parameters
	R9 =	<vector number=>vector_index>
	V and C flag are passed on to the vector

<=	dependent on vector called

This calls the vector given in R9. This is used for calling vectored routines which don't have any other entry point such as some calls to <RemV=>vector_remv> or <CnpV=>vector_CnpV>. Don't use this to call ByteV or some others, as the vector handler expects entry conditions you may not provide.
