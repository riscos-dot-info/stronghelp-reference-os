Hardware SWI vector
When a SWI instruction is decoded the processor will jump to this vector to find the code to process it. The processor mode is switched to SVC, and the address of the instruction causing the exception is in R14_svc.

When the SWI is processed it is entirely possible to drop back into user mode and execute code as if you are running the users program. Returning from such calls should be transparent to the system and you should NOT modify registers without good reason.

The default handler will check if the call belongs to the kernel and if so will branch through a table to the appropriate SWI handling code.
