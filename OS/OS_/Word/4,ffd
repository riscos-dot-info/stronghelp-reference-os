OS_Word 4
#Parent OS_Word
=>	R0 =	4
	R1 =	pointer to five byte block

This SWI sets the interval timer.

The timer is incremented 100 times a second, and generates <event 5=>event_5> when it reaches 0. (You must enable the event with <OS_Byte 14=>OS_Byte014>). To generate repeating events you would have to reload the timer on each event. The timer is obsolecent - use <OS_CallAfter> or <OS_CallEvery> instead.
