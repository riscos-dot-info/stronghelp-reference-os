OS_Word 15
#Parent OS_Word
=>	R0 =	15
	R1 =	pointer to parameter block
	R1+0 = reason code :
	  5 :	<Write CMOS clock and soft-copy time from 5-byte integer=>OS_Word15,5> (4.00+)
	  8 :	<Write CMOS clock and soft-copy time from string=>OS_Word15,8>
	  15 :	<Write CMOS clock and soft-copy date from string=>OS_Word15,15>
	  24 :	<Write CMOS clock and soft-copy time and date from string=>OS_Word15,24>

Nowhere does the PRM say how to determine the correct format of string to pass for the current territory. Presumably it is to be done by inspection from a time read with <OS_Word 14=>OS_Word14>.
# Well, that's easy to do generically
