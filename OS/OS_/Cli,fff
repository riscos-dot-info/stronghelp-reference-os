è	it checks the stack space, if there's not enough free memory to establish the stack the error 'No room for supervisor stack' is returned.
è	it checks the command line length. On pre-RO3.8, a CLI-command has to be less than 257 bytes long, including the terminator. If it's longer, the call is ignored without returning an error.
# 	On RO3.8 or later, the command line length has been expanded to 1024 bytes, included the terminator.
è	it then executes the command as any other *Command typed in CLI
#indent;Line
