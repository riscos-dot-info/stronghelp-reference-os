OS_CLI  (&05)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to string terminated by Null, Linefeed or Return
<=	R0 preserved

This executes a string passed to it as if it has been typed in the CLI. When it is called, it performs the following actions:
#Tab;Indent 2
	it checks the stack space, if there's not enough free memory to establish the stack the error 'No room for supervisor stack' is returned.
	it checks the command line length. Prior to RISC OS 4, a CLI-command has to be less than 257 bytes long, including the terminator. If it's longer, the call is ignored without returning an error. Later OS versions increase the limit to 1024 bytes including terminator.
	it then executes the command as any other *Command typed in CLI
#indent;Line
