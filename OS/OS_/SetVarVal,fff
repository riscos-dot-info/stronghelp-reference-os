OS_SetVarVal  (&24)
#Parent OS_
=>	R0 =	pointer to name
	R1 =	pointer to value to set to
	R2 =	length, or -1 to delete
	R3 =	name pointer (0 for 1st call)
	R4 =	<variable type=>OS_vartypes>

<=	R3 =	new name pointer
	R4 =	variable type

This SWI sets a variable's value to that specified, or deletes the variable. The name may be wildcarded for deletion and update (using '*' and '#'). Code variables will not be deleted unless R4 = 16. Literal strings do not need to be null terminated, as R2 is used for the length.

<OS_ReadVarVal> is marked as being re-entrant, which would allow it to re-enter the same code variable's read code. *No* note is made about this in the PRM and the <code variable example=>PRM-1:332> in the PRM calls <OS_Byte &87=>OS_Byte135> which has undefined re-entrancy. D'oh.
