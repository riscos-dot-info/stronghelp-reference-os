This call is identical to <OS_CallASWI>, except that it uses R12 to specify the target SWI. This may be more convenient in some environments. In particular under APCS-R, R10 is the stack limit pointer, which must be preserved at all times; if a SWI called using <OS_CallASWI> were to abort or generate an error the run-time library would usually examine R10 and decide that it had no stack to handle the abort or error. Therefore APCS-R libraries must use OS_CallASWIR12 (R12 being a scratch register under APCS-R).
