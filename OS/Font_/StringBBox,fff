#Parent Font_
=>	R1 =	pointer to string
<=	R1 =	min x, inclusive
	R2 =	min y, inclusive
	R3 =	max x, exclusive
	R4 =	max y, exclusive

This SWI returns the smallest possible box that covers the whole string. The box is returned in millipoints. This call cannot, due to rounding and anti-aliasing, be used to find size on screen.

In RISC OS 3 and later it is recommended to use <Font_ScanString>.
