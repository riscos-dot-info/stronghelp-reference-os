=>	R0 =	Font handle (if applicable)

This SWI paints a string to the screen using the currently selected font, or a specific font if flags indicate so. Any VDU 'origin' previously specified is ignored and absolute co-ordinates are assumed.

Note: Underline and rubout do not work unless transformed x-axis is parallel (not anti-parallel) to output x-axis. (Anti-parallel being parallel, but in the opposite direction to the original).
