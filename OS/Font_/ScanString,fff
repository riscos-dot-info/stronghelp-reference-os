Font_ScanString  (&400A1)
#Parent Font_
=>	R0 =	initial font handle, or 0 for current
	R1 =	pointer to string
	R2 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R3,4 =	(x,y) of mouse click, or max w,h of string
	R5 =	pointer to <block holding spacing, split & bounding box=>.block>
	R6 =	pointer to <transformation matrix=>Font_matrix>
	R7 =	length of string

<=	R1 =	pointer to where the scan ended
	R3,4 =	(x,y) of where the scan ended
	R7 =	number of split chars in scanned part of string.

This SWI is used to find various info on a string :

#Tab
		How wide is a string?
	 	Use large values for R3, R4 and no split character
		Given a width, how much of a string will fit?
AND		Address of a mouse click?
	 	Use correct width in R3, large value in R4 and (if needed) a split char in the buffer at R5
		Graphical position of a caret?
	 	Set R7 to offset into string, use huge values for R3,4, and no split

Registers 0,5,6 and 7 are only used if bits 8,5,6 and 7 are set in R2

If bit 8 of R2 is clear then the current font will be assumed. This call *does not* alter current font, so if you are scanning several sequential lines, and these can contain font shifts, you should call <Font_FutureFont> to find which font handle to pass in R0 the next time.

If bit 20 of R2 is set but there is no split character, then R7 will be used to return the number of non-control characters (codes 32 or greater and not within a control sequence)

Unlike <Font_Paint>, this call only allows millipoints for all coordinates. Convert to/from OS units by dividing/multiplying by 400. (Instead of dividing, you can multiply by (1\<\<18 / 400) and then shift down 18 to get an approximate answer)
