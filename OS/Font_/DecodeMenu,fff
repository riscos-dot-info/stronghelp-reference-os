=>	R0	=	<flags=>.flags>
	R1	=	pointer to menu definition, as per <Font_ListFonts>
	R2	=	pointer to menu selections, as per <Wimp_Poll=>Wimp:Wimp_Poll>
	R3	=	pointer buffer to contain result
	 	 	or 0 to return size
	R4	=	size of buffer (if R3 \<> 0)

<=	R0, R1, R3 preserved.
	R2	=	pointer to rest of menu selections
	R4	=	size of buffer required.
	 	 	or 0 for no font selection.

#tab
This SWI decodes the font or encoding menu, returning <a string with a format=>.results> dependent on whether the font/encoding names were specifed in a Messages{/}n{/} file in the font directory. If no Messages{/}n{/} file was found (and hence the font manager has found the font names by scanning the directory tree) the name field is absent.

Experimentation suggests that passing in a selection block pointing at System Font will generate an error, rather than set R4 = 0
