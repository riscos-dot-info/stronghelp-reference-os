Font_SwitchOutputToBuffer  (&4009E)
#Parent Font_
=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags> if R1 >0, else 0
	R1 =	pointer to word aligned buffer or
	 	8	to count buffer space needed
	 	0	to switch to normal output
	 	-1	to read state
<=	R0 =	previous flags
	R1 =	previous buffer pointer + size needed by Draw file structure.

This SWI allows calls to <Font_Paint> to be redirected to build <Draw file=>DrawFile_format> objects in the supplied buffer. R1 returned points at the 0 terminator (it and the new size remaining are not counted in the data generated). Each letter is converted to a filled path object, as are rubout box(es) and underlining. Before calling the buffer should be :

Offset	Contents
#Line
0	0
4	size remaining (bytes)
#Line
See <PRM 3, page 475=>PRM-3:475>.
#Subpage flags
Meaning of bits in R0 when set
0	Update R1 but don't actually store anything
1	Apply hints
4	Generate error if bitmapped characters found
2,3,5-31	0 (reserved)
