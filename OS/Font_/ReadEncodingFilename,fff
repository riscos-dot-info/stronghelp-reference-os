=>	R0 =	font handle
	R1 =	pointer to buffer
	R2 =	length of buffer
<=	R0 =	pointer to encoding filename (in buffer)
	R1 =	pointer to terminating 0 in buffer
	R2 =	free bytes in buffer

This SWI returns the filename of the encoding file, primarily of use to PDriverPS. The font manager only uses public encoding files with names of the form
    {/}font_prefix.{/}Encodings{/}.encoding{/}
PDriverPS uses the private encoding files with names of the form
    {/}font_prefix.font_name{/}Encoding
to find the PostScript names of the font's characters.
