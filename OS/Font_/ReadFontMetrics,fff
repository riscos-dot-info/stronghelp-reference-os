This SWI reads information in the font's IntMetrics file. Currently it is not permitted on fonts which have had a transformation matrix applied. All values are signed millipoints, unless specificly stated.

Width data is an array of 256 words, bounding box data an array of 256 * 4 words (x0, y0, x1, y1).

#Subpage flags

#Subpage kern
Kerning data
Kerning information is found by hash table lookup, using the function
    hash table index = (first letter) EOR (second letter ROR 4)
The second letter can be calculated by
    second letter = (first letter EOR hash table index) ROR 4
where both rotates are perfomed 8 bits only.

Data is stored as :

Size	Value
#Line
256 * 4	hash table of offsets to first kern pair with this hash value
4	offset of end of all pairs
4	flags - meaning when bits set:
	0	no bounding boxes
	1	no x offsets
	2	no y offsets
	31	'short' kern pairs
	3-30	undefined (reserved)
?	kern pair data (stored consecutively, in hash function order)

Kern pair data is stored as :

Size	Value
#Line
4	first letter of kern pair
4	x offset (if flag bit 1 clear)
4	y offset (if flag bit 1 clear)

If bit 31 of the flags is set, the kern data is compressed by combining the first two (or only two) words:

bits 0-7	first letter of kern pair
bits 8-31	x or y offset
