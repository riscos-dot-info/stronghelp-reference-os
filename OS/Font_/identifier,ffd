Font identifier strings
#Parent Font_FindFont
If the string does not start with '\\' it is assumed to be a font name ({/}i.e.{/} \\F is implicitly prepended). The identifer string consists of a series of qualifiers/value pairs:

#tab
Qualifier	Meaning
#Line
\\F		font identifier (RISC OS 2 old style font name) space/control terminated
\\f		territory number, space, font name (in the current territory's language and alphabet) control terminated
\\E		encoding identifier control terminated
\\e		territory number, space, encoding name control terminated
\\M		<transformation matrix=>font_matrix>, 6 1/1000th em values as *decimal* signed integers, all {*}6{*} followed by a space. The first 4 are actually interpreted as fixed point fractions of the form &XXXX·XXXX.
