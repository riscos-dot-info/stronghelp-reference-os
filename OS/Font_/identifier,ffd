Font identifier strings
#Parent Font_FindFont
If the string does not start with '\\' it is assumed to be a font name ({/}i.e.{/} \\F is implicitly prepended). The identifer string consists of a series of qualifiers/value pairs:

#tab
Qualifier	Meaning
#Line
\\F		font identifier (name of font directory) space/control terminated
\\f		territory number, space, font name (in the current territory's language and alphabet) control terminated
\\E		<encoding identifier=>font_utf8> control terminated
\\e		territory number, space, encoding name control terminated
\\M		<transformation matrix=>font_matrix>, 6 1/1000th em values as *decimal* signed integers, all {*}6{*} followed by a space. The first 4 are actually interpreted as fixed point fractions of the form &XXXX·XXXX.

The font identifier is the name of the font directory as it appears in Font$Path. The font name (given by \\f) is ignored by the font manager, but returned in the "Font 'n' not found" error message if the territory number matches the current territory.
