=>	R1 =	pointer to string
	R2 =	x offset in millipoints
	R3 =	y offset in millipoints

<=	R1 =	pointer to closest char
	R2 =	width of string
	R3 =	height of string
	R4 =	length of string
	R5 =	index of closest char

This SWI returns info about which char is closest to the given offset. To find this in a justified string, use <Font_FindCaretJ>.
