Font thresholds
Font thresholds are used by the Font Manager to convert from the 16 anti-alias levels in the font definition to the logical colours available. They are read and set using a table of the form:

Offset	Contents
#Line
0	Foreground colour offset
1	1st threshold value
2	2nd
3	...
n	&FF

For example in a 16 colour mode in the Wimp, background is 0, foreground is 1, foreground colour offset is 6, giving the table:

0	6
1	2
2	4
3	6
4	8
5	10
6	12
7	14
8	&FF
#tab

This causes the mapping from the 16 colours the font is defined in to the 8 available:

	In	Out	Threshold
	  0	0
	  1	0
	  2	1	  2
	  3	1
	  4	2	  4
	  5	2
	  6	3	  6
	  7	3
	  8	4	  8
	  9	4
	10	5	10
	11	5
	12	6	12
	13	6
	14	7	14
	15	7
