0-15	counter, should be 0 on first call

18	terminate with 13 rather than 0
19	return menu definition in R1, and indirected data in R4
20	place 'System font' at head of menu
21	tick font in R6, and its parent

Font_ListFonts Listing Fonts
When using <Font_ListFonts> to list fonts or encodings, or local names for fonts:
è	names are returned alphabetically sorted.
è	only bits 16-18 and bit 22 of the <flags=>.flags> in R2 should be used. All other bits must be clear.
è	do not alter R2 between the calls of finding required memory and finding the actual data.
è	when R2 = -1 on exit, then all fonts have been found and the returned data is invalid.
#
#subpage fontmenus
Font_ListFonts Font Menus
When using <Font_ListFonts> to create a font menu:
è	<Font_DecodeMenu> can be used to work out which font was selected.
è	the returned definition is suitable for opening with <Wimp_CreateMenu=>Wimp:Wimp_CreateMenu>
è	only bits 19-21 of the <flags=>.flags> in R2 should be used. All other bits must be clear.
#
#subpage ro2usage
Font_ListFonts RISC OS 2 compatibility
è	RISC OS 2 compatible mode is used if bits 16-31 of the <flags=>.flags> in R2 are clear.
è	This mode pretends that bits 16 and 18 of R2 were set, bits 17 and 19-31 were clear and that R3 was 40.
è	Under actual RISC OS 2, R3 is meant to point to the path to search, or -1 for Font$Path
