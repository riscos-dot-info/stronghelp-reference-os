Font_Paint Flags
#Parent Font_Paint
bit	meaning
#Line
0	1 = justify specified by graphics cursor, 0 = not justified
1	1 = rub-out box specified by graphics cursor, 0 = don't rub-out
4	1 = x and y are in OS, 0 = millipoints
5	justify & rub-out specified by block in R5 (bit 4 must be clear), 0 = use flags in bits 0,1
6	<Transformation matrix=>Font_matrix> specified by R6 (bit 4 must be clear)
7	Given string length
8	Given font
9	Kern
10	Right to left
11	<Background blending=>.blend> (RISC OS 3.70 or later {*}only{*})
12	R1 points to <16-bit string=>font_longstrings> (bit 13 must be clear) (FontManager 3.41+)
13	R1 points to <32-bit string=>font_longstrings> (bit 12 must be clear) (FontManager 3.41+)
17	Return caret position
18	Return bounding box
19	Return matrix
20	Return split count
Others	Reserved, must be zero

RISC OS 2 only recognises flags in bits 0,1,4

To specify justify using the graphics cursor, first move to right side. To specify a rub-out box using the graphics cursor, first move to lower left and then to upper right of box.

If both, then do justify move last.
#SubPage blend
Background Blending
To use background blending you must ensure:

è	You have checked with <Font_CacheAddr> that the Font Manager supports this bit, as versions earlier than 3.35 will complain if the bit is set.
è	Font colours specify 1 or more anti-aliasing colours, else the Font Manager will use 1bpp (non-aliased) painting.

As blending is slow you should avoid it on known uniform backgrounds.
