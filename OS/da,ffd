SWIs that should be used with care with dynamic areas
#Parent OS_
Some SWIs use some bits 31-27 for flags. With the introduction of dynamic areas into the memory map on RISC OS 3.5 or later, it is now possible for RAM to be located at addresses with these bits set. Thus some SWIs are limited in the range of memory to which pointers can be passed, and will fail mysteriously (possibly overwriting other areas of memory) if a pointer to memory with these bits sets is unwittingly passed.
